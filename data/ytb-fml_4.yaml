    that would have helped with audience retention in this video. Audience retention
    is an important metric that tells if the viewer actually enjoys the video. I asked
    if he thought he could fix it in editing or voice‐over, but he said no. There
    were some elements that were needed to make it happen in real time and editing
    wouldn't work. And he couldn't refilm the video because he couldn't cut open and

    to be homeless. He was unemployed for an extended period of time, which caused
    him to lose his house to foreclosure, and he had nowhere to go. He felt like he
    became invisible when he was homeless. This is why Mark was so personally passionate
    about the reason behind his YouTube channel. He said, “This isn't just talk. Each

- en: I first learned a very important principle when I started my company around
    the turn of the century. My clients were often the mom‐and‐pop type local businesses,
    and they were difficult to convince that spending money for online marketing was
    worth it at the time. I mean, we were still on dial‐up Internet. Do you know the
    dial‐up sound? I can still hear it in my head to this day. It took forever to
    connect to the Internet! Anyway, one of my first clients came to me for help with
    their marketing because they had tried TV, radio, newspapers, and other resources,
    and nothing seemed to be helping. I convinced them to let me do some online marketing
    for them.

    didn't recognize the correlation and didn't ask the customers where they had heard
    about them. They told me they no longer needed my services because business was
    booming. I was devastated to lose their business. They didn't take the time to
    figure out why the traffic was coming in the door, but I knew. I also knew their
    traffic would slow down when we quit our online marketing, which it did after
    a couple of months. They came back to me and we reengaged, and they ended up growing

    question was: How can you help more people outside of law school understand the

    audience already enjoyed watching and deconstruct them in a “Real Lawyer Reacts

    based on the type of channel you have; that's why it is so important to know who
    your love group is before extending to the mainstream. If you have an educational
    channel, you shouldn't take what a gaming channel is doing and copy it exactly
    then wonder why their successful strategy didn't work when you tried it. Content

    to convince the Squatty Potty owners and their *Shark Tank* investor that this
    would work. Originally, the plan was to use an artificial Clydesdale‐sized unicorn
    to poop because it was big enough to fit an ice‐cream machine inside, but Daniel
    Harmon, Jeffrey's brother and business partner, had the idea to use CG effects

    and director of the series about Jesus Christ called *The Chosen*. Ricky Ray Butler,

    hand got cut off, too, by the way). At the time of filming, only a few people

    the frying pan, saying, “This is your brain on drugs…. Any questions?” as viewers

    到底什么是内容？
- en: The phrase “Content is king” has been used before, but it is the best way to
    emphasize how true the statement is. As you can see from my own career path beginning
    at age six, content can change people's lives. Its messaging inspires, educates,
    shocks, and changes people to the core. When we talk about “content” on YouTube,
    one of the biggest mistakes people make is thinking that “content” equals “video.”
    Video is definitely a part of it, but content also includes the title, thumbnail,
    and other metadata. Your video should be done well, sure, but you must give equal—if
    not more—attention to your video's title and thumbnail, because they are the make‐or‐break
    factors when a viewer is deciding whether they will click and watch. You will
    learn in [Chapter 15](c15.xhtml) how to make a good title and thumbnail.

    it opened. Poor guy.” He and George have some back‐and‐forth. George complains
    about nice guys getting a bad rap, while Jerry theorizes that the restaurant owner
    probably has family in Pakistan waiting for him to send money. George weaves in
    two new storylines for the episode during this scene: the good guy predicament,
    and the girlfriend wanting him to wear cologne and take an IQ test. They''ve done

    end up partnering with the man because he''s too nice. Then George walks in holding

    Babu. He thinks he''s a nice guy by being a patron, and he even offers the owner
    some unsolicited advice to turn his multicultural, eclectic‐cuisine restaurant
    into a Pakistani restaurant exclusively. Jerry gets excited about what''s coming,
    because he thinks his “good guy” idea is going to be the reason for Babu''s imminent
    success. This is a great setup. Be careful not to go straight for the climax at
    this point, because you have to keep teasing the viewer. This is where Jerry reengages
    the buildup by going back to his binoculars and patting himself on the back for
    helping Babu. As a viewer, we see that Babu has closed for renovation, and we

    ends with Babu storming out of the room yelling at Jerry, “You''re a bad man!

    comedy show *Studio C*. This is the cherry on top, and *Studio C* does it extremely
    well. In the *Seinfeld* episode, Jerry is talking with his friends on the sidewalk
    in front of the closed restaurant. Elaine reveals her IQ score, making George
    feel bad, then Jerry asks what food everyone is up for. Jerry suggests Mexican,
    George wants Italian, and Elaine wants Chinese—an eclectic cuisine. Then Jerry
    says, “You know what would be great …” bringing it all back around to the original
    restaurant that had been there before Jerry opened his big mouth. George and Elaine
    glare at him, and the audience gets a last laugh. This is where you hide your
    hidden gem; it's the biggest value you have to offer, even on top of what the
    audience came for. Your viewers will come to expect this from you if you do it
    consistently, which is what will keep your retention up because your viewers won't

    In this example, Jerry talks about superheroes, the ultimate good guys, who hide
    their identity to keep people from criticizing them for the collateral damage
    that happens when they''re saving the world. He''s defending his “good deed” even
    though it didn''t actually do anybody any good in the end. It''s a fun way to

- en: Some of you might be thinking, “But I'm not using YouTube to grow an audience;
    I am using YouTube to sell.” Whether you're making a video to build an audience
    or making an ad to sell a product, the formula is the same. Although, when you
    want your viewers to buy something, you make content with a problem‐solution formula
    in mind. You must explain a problem your viewers can relate to, and when you offer
    a solution, you back it with credibility. The original direct marketing master
    was the infomercial guy, Ron Popeil, who coined the phrase, “But wait, there's
    more!” that people quote to this day. Ron followed the formula for making good
    content by putting it together in a story, even when his end goal was to get people
    to pick up the phone and buy a product. He engaged with the audience with a quick
    hook and a problem that a lot of people could relate to.

  zh: 你们中有些人可能会想：“但我不是用YouTube来扩大观众群体；我是用YouTube来销售。” 无论你是制作视频来建立观众群体，还是制作广告来销售产品，公式都是一样的。
    尽管当你希望你的观众购买某样东西时，你要以解决问题的公式来制作内容。 你必须解释一个你的观众能够产生共鸣的问题，当你提供解决方案时，你要以可信度来支持它。
    最初的直销大师是电视购物节的人，Ron Popeil，他创造了人们至今仍在引用的短语“但等等，还有更多！” Ron遵循了制作优质内容的公式，通过故事将其组合在一起，即使他的最终目标是让人们拿起电话购买产品。
    他用一个快速的引子和很多人能够产生共鸣的问题来吸引观众。
- en: In the early 1950s, Ron filmed the first‐ever prime‐time infomercial for his
    food chopper called the Chop‐O‐Matic. He began with a visual hook, demonstrating
    the ease and speed of the “greatest kitchen appliance ever made” (there's the
    verbal hook, too). He proceeds by telling the folks that the Chop‐O‐Matic will
    make their cake baking, candy making, and ice‐cream sundae topping exponentially
    easier. These specific food‐making tasks were not randomly pulled out of a hat.
    Ron had asked crowds at product demonstrations which kitchen tasks were most problematic,
    and the majority of answers came down to chopping nuts for those three reasons.
    So he addressed the biggest problem first. He continues to use the problem‐solution
    strategy as the video goes on, showing a remarkable speed and ease in chopping
    anything from celery to ice. He claims that the chopper's crowning feature is
    that it chops onions so quickly that it saves your hands and your eyes. No more
    tears!

  zh: 在20世纪50年代初，Ron为他的食品切碎机Chop-O-Matic拍摄了史上第一部黄金时段广告。他从一个视觉吸引开始，展示了“有史以来最伟大的厨房器具”的便利和速度（口头上也有吸引）。他继续告诉大家，Chop-O-Matic将使他们的蛋糕烘焙、糖果制作和冰淇淋圣代制作变得更加容易。这些特定的食物制作任务并不是随意挑出来的。Ron曾在产品演示中询问人群，哪些厨房任务最麻烦，大多数答案都归结为为了这三个原因切碎坚果。所以他首先解决了最大的问题。随着视频的进行，他继续使用问题-解决方案策略，展示了从芹菜到冰的任何东西都能迅速、轻松地切碎。他声称这个切碎机的最大特点是它可以快速切碎洋葱，从而保护你的手和眼睛。不再流泪！
- en: 'Ron appealed to both women and men at different points in the ad, hitting his
    number one customer first (the wives and mothers), and his backup demographic
    second (the men). The visual sale worked on its own, but paired with a flawless
    script, discounted price, and bonus recipe book, the Chop‐O‐Matic was a slam dunk
    campaign. It made millions and launched Ron''s extremely successful career. His
    content, like all great content, grabbed attention, explained simply, built to
    a climax, and had a payoff at the end. To make the sale, he presented a problem,
    offered a solution, and demonstrated his credibility again and again.  ## It Works

    of three other channels that would be an ideal fit for him (one had 1,000 subs,
    another had 5,000 subs, and one had 15,000 subs). He approached them, despite

    only the table. Three days after uploading it to his channel, his CTR was low

    table. Some of his previous thumbnails showed John pouring something and had gotten
    a lot of views, so we thought he should use that tactic here. He poured the “lava”
    into a bucket, and an arrow pointed at the finished product. Then we watched his
    CTR—it immediately jumped up to 8.9%. A video that was on its way to being one
    of his lower performing videos is now a top performer … all because John sought

    It needed to be easy to remember and simple to explain and share, and it needed
    to stand out above the other campaigns. He said, “Dad, you know I hate attention.
    I hate the spotlight.” It's true; since he was a little kid, Logan was always
    uncomfortable with attention. I pushed him a little, saying maybe he needed to
    get out of his comfort zone. But then he said, “I don't want to be fake. I'm just
    me.” *Boom*. An idea struck me. His campaign messaging would be, “No Slogan, Just
    Logan.” It effectively grabbed people's attention and was easy to remember. The

- en: 'In earlier chapters, you learned that YouTube''s job is to predict what the
    viewer will watch. The AI is really sensitive to everything that viewers engage
    with on the platform, and it actually starts with an impression. An impression
    happens when a viewer is able to see a title and thumbnail for at least one second.
    This could be on the YouTube Homepage, Subscription feed, in Search results, or
    Suggested feed (Up next). If the viewer skips by the title and thumbnail quicker
    than one second, it doesn''t count as an impression. If they click, that''s what
    records your click‐through rate (CTR). An important note: the higher the impressions
    and CTR data the better. That means YouTube is recommending your video out to
    a more general audience. The more it recommends, the more impressions you will
    get. The more impressions you get, the lower your CTR. So don''t freak out that
    your CTR percentage is dropping when your impressions and views go up. That''s
    a good thing because YouTube is showing it to more viewers outside your “normal

    and their team and I created the Squatty Potty ad, we made a Google doc for title
    ideas and added every variation we could think of. There are no “dumb” ideas in
    brainstorming, because anything can inspire a great title. We needed to figure
    out what was going to pique human curiosity and make them click. Because more
    clicks would bring us more people taking action to buy. We knew we had to test
    our options, so we did 165 title variations to see how viewers responded to them.
    We all had our favorites, but we had to choose based on the data—the data doesn't
    lie! And we really wanted to get it right because we had a lot riding on this
    campaign. Success was our only option. The best way to see which title and thumbnail
    brought the highest CTR was to run Facebook engagement ads. We created several

    and thumbnail for each video he makes. If he can''t come up with a clickable title
    and thumbnail, he won''t make the video, no matter how good the video idea is.
    Ever! Trust me, I''ve tried to convince him to. Most creators think only after
    shooting the video and right before uploading, “What should I do for the title
    and thumbnail?” This is a huge mistake and it could cost you the video''s potential
    success. Put a lot of thought into what people will want to click. This is critical
    because if they don''t click, they won''t watch. That''s why Jimmy strategizes
    before he makes every single video. We literally have spent days coming up with
    the right title and thumbnail. Not hours, days. Let that fact make you stop and
    think about your title and thumbnail creation process and priority. Make it a
    priority. You don''t need to go to the extreme like MrBeast does, but you should
    be thinking about your potential viewer and what would motivate them to click.
    This will help you when you are creating the video as well. Viewer first!  ##

    in advertising. I spent hours trying to figure out how it applied to grabbing
    people's attention. To summarize, the visual cortex of the brain is what processes
    visual information. There are four areas to the visual cortex called V1, V2, V3,
    and V4\. There are also special areas of the visual cortex that process visual
    information very quickly. These are called the “preattention” areas because they
    process information faster. Let me show you how this works.

    is the Fusiform Facial Area (FFA). This part of the brain is sensitive to human
    faces and is close to the area of the brain that processes emotions. This serves
    as an explicit trigger in thumbnails because the brain has circuits devoted to
    faces. When my daughter Ellie was four months old, I was reading a study about
    how babies can recognize faces and emotional expressions starting at about three
    months old. Of course, I had to put it to the test. I tested six facial expressions

    the “Rule of Thirds.” It's an effective technique to compose a balanced photo
    by dividing it into thirds, both horizontally and vertically. The subject of the
    image is positioned at the intersection of those dividing lines or along one of
    the lines itself. The dividing lines of the Rule of Thirds effectively breaks

    set it as the thumbnail image. If the video's creator didn't like the auto‐image,
    they had to re‐upload until they liked the option YouTube chose. I know, because

    used baiting techniques like bright colors, arrows, emotionally charged facial
    expressions, and big cleavage shots to get viewers to click on their videos. They

    didn''t take long for them to realize that the content didn''t show what was advertised
    in the thumbnail. YouTube noticed trends in the data from the new custom thumbnail
    feature, so they started using different metrics to inform their Suggested video
    recommendations. This helped to minimize the clickbait problem (see [Chapter 2](c02.xhtml)

    audience, so you can''t compare graphs or expect similar patterns. Joe Rogan''s
    YouTube channel has amazing Watch time because people watch his videos all the
    way through and then they watch more. Don''t worry about Joe Rogan or keeping

    Did you use a call to action? Did you say or do something funny? Did you add an
    endscreen, suggest another video, or use an interesting filming or editing technique?
    Did you say a trigger phrase? Trigger phrases can reengage or disengage your audience,
    so make sure you do the former. Say things like, “Don't miss the bonus tip at

- en: YouTube makes it easy to monitor everything that happens on your channel. For
    monitoring how long viewers stay on your video, there is a metric called average
    view duration, or AVD. If you have a 10‐minute video and YouTube says your AVD
    is 2:30, that means on average your viewers watch 2 minutes and 30 seconds of
    your video. In case you're wondering, this is not a good AVD. The second metric
    to look at for retention is called average view percentage, or AVP. This is the
    average percentage of the video that people watch before leaving. So if your AVP
    says 63%, this means that on average your viewers watch 63% of the total video
    before leaving.

  zh: YouTube让监控频道上发生的一切变得很容易。要监控观众观看你视频的时间有一个叫做平均观看时长（AVD）的指标。如果你有一个10分钟的视频，YouTube说你的AVD是2:30，这意味着平均来说你的观众会观看你视频的2分30秒。如果你在想，这不是一个好的AVD。用于保留的第二个指标叫做平均观看百分比（AVP）。这是人们在离开之前平均观看视频的百分比。所以如果你的AVP是63%，这意味着平均来说你的观众会观看视频的63%然后离开。
- en: AVD and AVP do not match up perfectly because of the way people consume your
    video. For instance, I watch all videos at 2× speed. So on a 10:00 video, my AVD
    would be 5:00, but my AVP would be 100%. For long‐term channel growth, these two
    metrics are key. The title and thumbnail will get you views, but AVD and AVP will
    get you Watch time and the right kind of audience. The longer you can keep viewers
    watching the more engaged they become, which turns into a loyal audience. The
    goal is to balance these two metrics and increase them together. YouTube provides
    multiple metrics to help with this. Take a look at [Figures 16.1](#c16-fig-0001)
    through [16.3](#c16-fig-0003) as an explanation.

    get at recognizing when you need to reengage your audience. But you have to be
    an active viewer and pay attention to when people lose interest on your videos.
    Pay attention to what pulls you in and what pulls you out of a video so you know
    how to use engagement tactics. Always keep in mind your hook and your storytelling
    to keep your viewer interested. If you're not sure where to add pattern interrupts
    when you watch a video, the good news is that YouTube gives you the data to figure
    it out. Look at the data to know where you need reengagement.

    ask in Search, giving the most asked questions priority. If your content pops
    up at the top of the results, viewers are more likely to click on your video,

    How? Let's say you create a video to answer one of your frequently asked questions.
    In this video, you also should bring in an SAQ that relates to the FAQ at hand.
    This strategy satisfies your viewer's curiosity, gives them even more than what
    they came for, and still provides a smooth viewing experience that is digestible
    and brings value. Further, another great strategy to use here is to create another
    video (or two or three … ) with the same line of questions in mind. Then you can
    recommend they watch it next, either verbally or with an end card or both. There's
    also a higher probability that YouTube might put it in the Suggested videos. This
    is a great way to keep the viewer engaged and watching more of your content or
    buying your products. When you do this, the AI is very happy and will reward you
    by pushing your content to other similar viewers.

- en: I like to look at Search as an entry point into your world of content. Most
    creators and YouTube educators focus on Search and ranking, but for me, I look
    at it as a funnel for bringing in additional traffic. When you get the initial
    traffic on your content, you can turn it into consumption traffic, meaning you've
    converted your first‐time viewers into repeat consumers of your content. Matthew
    Patrick, or “MatPat,” is a YouTube creator who has successful channels in a variety
    of genres. He uses Search well as a funnel. For example, if you search “Do video
    games cause violence?” MatPat's video “Do Video Games Cause Violence? It's Complicated”
    tops results including serious science and news channels. But what's important
    is what you see after you click on his video—several of his other videos suggested
    to watch next. He now has a new viewer consuming his content. He's done the same
    thing with other highly searchable FAQs in his genre, like, “How does the Force
    work?” and “What is a Yoshi?” (These actually are some of the most important questions
    you could ever ask. Anything to do with Star Wars or Super Mario Bros. should
    be at the top of your need‐to‐know list.)

    well because viewers watch them in a specific order. Also, YouTube notices the
    IDs that are grouped together. So if someone is watching a video that was tied
    in from a playlist, then there is a higher probability that the algorithm will
    plug in that related video to the recommendation feed. This doesn't happen every
    time; it's based on what the viewer does next. But if you have a small percentage

- en: To accelerate visibility, use a “tent pole” strategy. Think about how a tent
    pole holds up its side of the tent. There is a “peaking” effect at the top of
    the tent. The peak represents an event or something relevant to a group's general
    knowledge. This could be a holiday. It could be the opening day of a big movie.
    It could be the Super Bowl or the World Cup in soccer. Align your video topic
    and content around one of these tent pole peaks to accelerate your channel's visibility
    in conjunction with that thing.

    of BYUtv's comedy sketch channel, *Studio C*, we looked at a calendar and brainstormed
    what regional, national, and worldwide events would be happening that year. The
    other cocreator, Matt Meese, was also a head writer and actor. He brought up an
    idea he had always wanted to make into a video with a soccer match. So we looked
    at when the men's NCAA soccer championship landed on the calendar, mid‐November,
    and we set our sights on a video release. We used two big schools, Yale and North
    Carolina, as opponents in our video. Matt wrote an amazing script. The goalie,
    Matt as “Scott Sterling,” had the unfortunate role of taking a soccer ball to
    the face over and over (with the help of some great VFX, good editing, a soft
    soccer ball, and good make‐up).

    audience know exactly what they're going to get with a particular type of video,
    and they get their payoff when you deliver. Then you can wash, rinse, and repeat
    on each type of video. When you do it right, you'll have a low churn rate, meaning
    you'll lose fewer viewers. To be clear, having categories or buckets is not the
    same as having a variety channel. Variety channels don't work. Buckets are categories
    that are related, not random. Narrow down your niche, but don't be so narrow that
    the viewers lose interest because you have no variety.

    know exactly why they want to belong to your community? They want to know what
    you believe in and why you've come together. According to Patrick, “The Creed
    is a central idea that everyone wants to be associated with.” Some communities'
    first identifier is their Creed. Think of “Semper Fi” and the Marines, or Nike's
    “Just Do It.” If you know the brand, you can recite the Creed. Our Creed at *The
    Chosen* has evolved as our community has grown. It began as a rally cry. We didn't
    want anyone in Hollywood controlling the creative process; we wanted to hold the
    gold to create the content because then we could create based on our own rules.
    This is why we needed crowdfunding to work.

  zh: 第二个基本原则是你的信条。这是你的信仰系统。如果你的价值观和原则对你来说不够清晰，那么它们怎么能清晰到足以让你的追随者知道他们为什么想要加入你的社区呢？他们想知道你相信什么，以及你们聚集在一起的原因。根据帕特里克的说法，“信条是每个人都想要与之联系的中心思想。”一些社区的第一个标识就是他们的信条。想想“Semper
    Fi”和海军陆战队，或者耐克的“只管去做”。如果你知道这个品牌，你就能背诵出信条。我们在*The Chosen*的信条随着我们社区的成长而不断发展。它起初是一个集结的呼声。我们不想让好莱坞的任何人控制创意过程；我们想要掌握黄金来创造内容，因为这样我们就可以根据自己的规则创作。这就是为什么我们需要众筹来实现。
- en: 'As *The Chosen*''s community grew, our Creed changed based on feedback and
    interactions with our followers. In episode 7 of season one, Peter argues against
    Jesus''s call to Matthew to leave everything and follow him. Matthew was Peter''s
    tax collector, and he needed him to stay. He tells Jesus that Matthew''s job as
    tax collector warranted him staying, that Matthew''s situation is different from
    his own. Jesus''s reply, “Get used to different,” became a catchphrase that viewers
    really responded to. So it became a Creed. We have since printed it on merchandise.
    The same thing happened with the phrase, “Binge Jesus.” Our viewers latched onto
    it, and we integrated it into our Creed and our products as well. Sometimes the
    Creed comes from the community and gets adopted by the brand or creator, and sometimes
    it comes from the top down. It''s an organic process that you need to be aware
    of as you pull your community together.  ## Icons'

    know how to identify you, which brings us to the third fundamental: Icons. Icons
    are any representation of your brand. Patrick''s explanation is simple, but perfect:
    “Icons remind us that we are in this place, not that place.” Like if you walk
    into a shoe and apparel store and see a “swoosh” printed on every product—I don''t
    even have to tell you you''re in a Nike store, not Adidas or Reebok. The Icon
    is so ingrained in us. Mickey Mouse ears = Disney. The American flag = the United
    States, patriotism, pride, and more. As you can see from this last example, Icons
    can be associated with more than a place or a company; they can stand for values,
    visions, and feelings. Shapes, sounds, smells, and tastes all can be iconic as
    well. Patrick also says that Icons are “quick concentrations of meaning that we

    product design, experiences, and environments.'

  zh: 现在他们知道你来自哪里，你的立场是什么，他们需要知道如何识别你，这就引出了第三个基本原则：图标。图标是你品牌的任何代表。帕特里克的解释很简单，但很完美：“图标提醒我们我们在这个地方，而不是那个地方。”就像当你走进一家鞋类和服装店，看到每个产品上都印有一个“勾”，我甚至都不用告诉你你在耐克店，而不是阿迪达斯或锐步。图标已经深深地植入我们的心中。米老鼠的耳朵=迪士尼。美国国旗=美国、爱国主义、自豪感等等。正如你从最后一个例子中看到的，图标不仅可以与地方或公司相关联，还可以代表价值观、愿景和情感。形状、声音、气味和味道也都可以成为图标。帕特里克还说，图标是“我们立刻能够识别并对其产生某种感觉的快速意义集中体”。它们可以是标志、包装、产品设计、体验和环境。

    and included works like *Psycho*, *The Man with the Golden Arm*, *The Shining*,
    *West Side Story*, and *Big*. We wanted to capture a Saul Bass essence for our

    about, now they need to see how you go about it. A fun classic example of a Ritual
    comes from the 1960s Batman TV series. At the end of every episode, the narrator

    神圣的词汇/词典
- en: 'The fifth fundamental in community building is how the people talk. It''s called
    Sacred Words or Lexicon. Words identify us. Whether you speak English, Spanish,
    Mandarin, or Klingon, that language identifies you as a part of a culture of speakers
    or citizens of a specific place. The same is true of communities in sports, companies,
    gaming, music, and online platforms. Patrick''s favorite example of Sacred Words
    is ordering a drink at Starbucks: iced grande skinny vanilla latte. You have to
    know the words so they get your order right. Even families have their own Sacred
    Words. If I said, “I love you six times,” or, “Be of good cheer,” to someone in

- en: Creed and Sacred Words can blend, so our “Get used to different” Creed also
    belongs in *The Chosen*'s Lexicon. People who don't belong to our community don't
    understand what it means. Knowing the right words proves that you belong. If you
    don't get it, you're an outsider. It's actually great to have outsiders—when a
    community's Lexicon is shared verbally or virtually or on merchandise, it allows
    outsiders the opportunity to ask what it means. Community members can then spread
    brand awareness, which brings in more people to the group.

    to tape concerts, which was unique in the pre‐smartphone era. Concert tape trading
    became a Deadhead Ritual that prolonged the group's allegiance and longevity even

    emotion, because it creates that curiosity you want in a potential viewer. Always
    be honest. Your thumbnail and title need to actually reflect what the video is
    about, or you'll probably have a low average view duration (AVD). Use catchy,
    clickable titles that hook humans (not robots). A good rule of thumb for titles
    is to be catchy but concise. Put your main or primary keyword as close to the
    front of the title as possible—this helps you get ranked and suggested. Of course,
    your title has to be relevant. Sensational, irrelevant titles create low AVD.

    Why wouldn't you want to give your viewer more ways to watch more of your content?
    However, don't make the mistake of putting a card in the first third of the video
    because you don't want the viewer bouncing too soon and ruining your AVD. In your
    cards and endscreens, choose a video from your library that the viewer is more
    likely to be interested in. I call this the target video. Think about your target
    video in preproduction along with your title and thumbnail, because connecting
    your data and your buckets is your ultimate goal. I also use a feature on endscreens
    called “best for viewer” that lets the algorithm choose a video from my library
    that it thinks that particular viewer is likely to watch. Use this to supplement,
    not replace, your target video suggestion. In addition, take the last 8 to 10
    seconds to use a verbal call to action asking them to watch the target video.
    Even if the percentage of people who click on your suggested cards and endscreens
    is low, it's still activity that the AI is watching and will reward. And guess
    what happens when they do click on your suggestion? The algorithm recognizes the
    connection and puts it in the Suggested feed.

    like a virtual pat on the back. When I do work with clients through my agency,
    I do split test after split test running ads against organic content. For any
    job that I do, I want to create an ad that will convert 100% of the time and not
    be a Band‐Aid for a numbers problem. I do not advocate putting a Google paid strategy

    then pulls the call to action into the script, keeping the viewer engaged by adding
    the comedic element to the CTA. They finish out the sketch, and at the end, the
    CTA box pops on screen again. The trainer adds sarcastic comments to the merchandise
    push, telling viewers not to buy it for their friends and family, mentioning the

    the average score of the five classes combined, it looks like you're doing fine.
    This overall score can't show you that what is bringing the average down a little
    is actually a failing grade. But if you break down the grades by class, you'll
    see that the one class needs some serious attention, stat. This is why you need
    to go from a macro view to a micro view when determining your baselines and knowing
    which content to tweak. In order to do this, you have to break it down to the
    traffic sources level.

    if your impressions have gone up, it means the AI is pushing your video to a broader
    audience. More eyes get the chance to see your thumbnail and title, which is a
    good thing, so even if this makes your CTR number lower, your video is actually
    getting seen by more viewers! This is a hard concept for a lot of creators to

    will see that you''ve made a quick change and respond accordingly. I worked with
    a client who had a great thumbnail and a great video. Before he uploaded it to
    his channel, he asked our Discord group for feedback and got some great advice.
    But when he uploaded the video, it was falling under his baseline, so we switched
    out the thumbnail, not once or twice, but three times. Finally, the video took

    Bennett's YouTube channel is *The Ohana Adventure*, or *TOA*, as they call it.
    It's a family vlog channel that provides a comfortable lifestyle for the Bennett
    family, but it wasn't always that way. In 2013, Jase had gotten his longboard
    brand, jaseboards, into Costco and other big retail spaces when an underwater
    skateboarding video went viral on YouTube. Jase saw an opportunity on YouTube
    for his wife, Rachel, who had been a regular blogger for many years. Rachel liked
    the idea of starting a family vlog, so *TOA* was born.

  zh: 让我给你讲一个关于一个令人惊叹的YouTube家庭的故事。Jase和Rachel Bennett的YouTube频道是*The Ohana Adventure*，或者他们称之为*TOA*。这是一个家庭视频博客频道，为Bennett家庭提供了舒适的生活方式，但并不总是这样。2013年，Jase将他的长板品牌jaseboards引入Costco和其他大型零售空间，当时一段水下滑板视频在YouTube上走红。Jase看到了YouTube上的机会，为他多年来一直是常规博主的妻子Rachel。Rachel喜欢开始一个家庭视频博客的想法，于是*TOA*诞生了。
- en: 'Rachel began vlogging without much direction. In the beginning, she didn''t
    even watch other YouTube channels to see what other vlogging families were doing.
    But she did do something powerful: she found her Why. She wanted to be one of
    those families who could inspire others to nurture healthy family relationships
    by having fun together. It took nine months to get any views, and when the channel
    hit a hundred subscribers, it felt amazing (as good as a million subscribers would
    feel down the road).'

  zh: Rachel开始时并没有太多方向性地进行视频博客。起初，她甚至没有观看其他YouTube频道，看看其他视频博客家庭在做什么。但她做了一件强大的事情：她找到了她的目标。她想成为那些能够通过共同玩乐来激发他人培养健康家庭关系的家庭之一。花了九个月才有任何观看次数，当频道达到一百名订阅者时，感觉很棒（就像以后达到一百万名订阅者会感觉一样）。
- en: 'One video in particular boosted *TOA*''s YouTube success. Rachel did a “How
    to Shave Your Legs” video with her preteen daughter. This triggered a nice run
    with monetization that made Jase decide to quit his job and go full time on YouTube
    with his family. The Bennetts filmed everything in the regular life of a family,
    including the “ah‐oh” moments, like a kid bonking his head or getting another
    injury. Then along came the Children''s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
    and a super strict response from YouTube: all “questionable” kids'' content got
    demonetized, including *The Ohana Adventure* because of their “ah‐oh” content.
    This was a hard blow to the Bennett family, whose livelihood depended on their
    YouTube income.'

  zh: 特别是有一个视频推动了*TOA*的YouTube成功。Rachel和她的青少年女儿一起做了一个“如何刮腿毛”的视频。这触发了一段不错的赚钱期，让Jase决定辞去工作，全职在YouTube上和家人一起工作。Bennetts拍摄了家庭生活中的一切，包括“啊哦”时刻，比如孩子撞到头或受伤。然后《儿童在线隐私保护法》（COPPA）和YouTube的超严格反应出现了：所有“可疑”的儿童内容都被取消了广告，包括*The
    Ohana Adventure*，因为他们的“啊哦”内容。这对Bennett家庭来说是一个沉重的打击，他们的生计依赖于他们在YouTube上的收入。
- en: I had a conversation with Jase and Rachel at this time. We talked about the
    importance of creating data relationships among their videos and getting their
    content in the Suggested feed. We talked about collaborating with other family
    vloggers. They made a new plan based on these ideas, and they committed to it.
    Rachel was determined to get her channel back on track, so she gave herself a
    deadline to reestablish monetization, and she got to work making better content.

  zh: 这个时候我和Jase和Rachel进行了一次对话。我们谈到了在视频中创建数据关系的重要性，以及让他们的内容出现在推荐频道中。我们谈到了与其他家庭视频博主合作的事情。他们基于这些想法制定了新计划，并承诺要实施。Rachel决心让她的频道重新回到正轨，所以她给自己设定了一个重新建立货币化的截止日期，并开始努力制作更好的内容。
- en: Jase and Rachel surrounded themselves with like‐minded people and did some great
    collaborations. They even shared audiences, topics, and upload schedules with
    similar family vloggers. They made sure their audience had good crossover data
    with the channels they chose to collaborate with so they would get the right viewers
    watching their content. Every Monday night for two years they did a live stream
    and played family games. They knew consistency was important, so they never missed
    a week. This was a new strategy that gave their audience a chance to connect deeper.
    Viewers had great comments that gave them ideas for more videos, and they listened.

  zh: Jase和Rachel让自己与志同道合的人为伍，并进行了一些很棒的合作。他们甚至与类似的家庭视频博主分享了观众、主题和上传时间表。他们确保他们的观众与他们选择合作的频道有良好的交叉数据，这样他们就能吸引到合适的观众观看他们的内容。两年来，每个星期一晚上，他们都会进行直播并玩家庭游戏。他们知道一贯性很重要，所以他们从未错过过一周。这是一个新策略，让他们的观众有机会更深入地联系。观众们给了他们很好的评论，给了他们更多视频的创作灵感，而他们也在倾听。
- en: Audience engagement was huge. When they listened to suggestions and gave shout‐outs,
    it pulled their ideal viewers into their content even more. Jase started doing
    a silly rap at the end of every live stream where he would plug viewers' usernames
    into the rap. This gave him the idea to do a video with his daughter that parodied
    Taylor Swift's song, “Look What You Made Me Do.” The parody became their most
    viewed video with more than 100 million views. Because of this video's huge success,
    they made more videos with data relationships to connect to that content bucket
    and to their overall content. They made videos of the parody's bloopers, behind
    the scenes, and choreography. This strategy to build more content around what
    was working gave them $20,000 in AdSense in the first week.

  zh: 观众参与度非常重要。当他们倾听建议并进行宣传时，吸引了他们理想的观众更多地关注他们的内容。Jase开始在每次直播结束时做一个愚蠢的说唱，他会在说唱中插入观众的用户名。这给了他一个创意，他和女儿一起做了一个模仿泰勒·斯威夫特的歌曲“Look
    What You Made Me Do”的视频。这个模仿视频成为他们观看次数最多的视频，观看次数超过1亿次。由于这个视频的巨大成功，他们制作了更多与该内容桶和整体内容相关的数据关系的视频。他们制作了模仿视频的花絮、幕后花絮和编舞视频。围绕正在起作用的内容建立更多内容的策略使他们在第一周就获得了2万美元的广告收入。
- en: Every YouTube channel makes mistakes, and *TOA* was no exception. Jase and Rachel
    got caught up in the comparison trap, thinking if they started to copy what other
    successful creators were doing, it would work for them, too. It didn't. Jase got
    stuck in an algorithm mindset, creating content for the machine instead of for
    their viewers. They had stopped speaking to their own audience, and their channel
    went from getting millions of views a day to getting 500,000 at best. Their channel
    was dying, losing momentum and interest of the viewers.

  zh: 每个YouTube频道都会犯错，*TOA*也不例外。Jase和Rachel陷入了比较的陷阱，认为如果他们开始模仿其他成功创作者的做法，那对他们也会奏效。但事实并非如此。Jase陷入了算法思维，创作内容是为了机器而不是为了观众。他们停止了与自己的观众交流，他们的频道从每天获得数百万次观看，跌至最多只有50万次。他们的频道濒临垂死，失去了观众的动力和兴趣。
- en: So they regrouped. They went back to their ideal viewer, which was actually
    an older kid demographic, and slowly started to get their metrics back up. Now
    they are careful to gear new content to the right audience. The kids have separate
    channels from the family channel, and each appeals to different audiences based
    on their age and topics. Because they have grown up on YouTube, the kids know
    their audience well and do a good job creating content for their ideal viewer.

  zh: 所以他们重新集结起来。他们回到了他们的理想观众，实际上是一个年龄较大的孩子群体，并慢慢开始恢复他们的指标。现在他们小心翼翼地将新内容定位到正确的观众。孩子们有自己的频道，与家庭频道分开，每个频道根据他们的年龄和主题吸引不同的观众。因为他们在YouTube上长大，孩子们很了解他们的观众，并且在为他们的理想观众创作内容方面做得很好。
- en: Jase and Rachel chose YouTube as their family's career and main source of income,
    but it's important to them that they keep it fun for the kids. They live and create
    by the mantra “Inspire, not require.” They've tried, failed, analyzed, and adjusted
    to get to where they are now. Their collective channels have millions of subscribers—people
    who are inspired to have good old‐fashioned fun and healthy familial relationships.
    The best part is they went back to their original Why from when they started on
    YouTube.

  zh: Jase和Rachel选择了YouTube作为他们家庭的事业和主要收入来源，但对他们来说，让孩子们开心玩耍也很重要。他们以“激励，而非要求”为信条生活和创作。他们尝试过、失败过、分析过，并做出调整，才走到了现在的地步。他们的频道总共有数百万订阅者，这些人受到启发，希望能够享受传统的快乐和健康的家庭关系。最重要的是，他们回到了他们在YouTube开始时的初衷。
- en: When I asked Rachel what advice she would give to herself if she could go back
    to when she started her YouTube channel, she said she would tell herself to figure
    out what content performed best so she could do more like it. She would be more
    consistent. She would have good metadata and create viewing data relationships
    among her content. But maybe most important of all, she would tell herself not
    to let the blunders get you down. Just move on, and make better content.

  zh: 当我问Rachel如果她能回到开始她的YouTube频道时，她会给自己什么建议，她说她会告诉自己找出哪种内容表现最好，这样她就可以做更多类似的内容。她会更加一贯。她会有良好的元数据，并在她的内容之间建立观看数据关系。但也许最重要的是，她会告诉自己不要让错误打击自己。继续前进，创作更好的内容。
- en: YouTube's own history follows the formula to try, fail, analyze, and adjust
    with data‐driven decisions. Jawed Karim, Chad Hurley, and Steven Chen started
    YouTube with the intention of making it a dating website. It didn't work, so they
    looked at what was working, and changed their strategy to match the data. You
    have to follow their example, and *TOA*'s, if you really want to succeed on YouTube.
    You now have the tools you need to be smart in your preparation, creation, and
    follow‐up, meaning you know what it takes to try, fail, analyze, and adjust based
    on data. Utilizing the data to your advantage takes the guesswork out of your
    YouTube channel and not only helps you succeed, it feels incredibly empowering.

  zh: YouTube自己的历史遵循着尝试、失败、分析和根据数据做出决策的公式。Jawed Karim、Chad Hurley和Steven Chen创办YouTube的初衷是把它做成一个约会网站。但这个想法行不通，所以他们看了看什么是有效的，改变了他们的策略以符合数据。如果你真的想在YouTube上取得成功，你必须效仿他们的例子，以及*TOA*的例子。现在你拥有了必要的工具，可以在准备、创作和后续工作中做出明智的决策，这意味着你知道如何根据数据进行尝试、失败、分析和调整。利用数据对你有利，可以消除YouTube频道的猜测，不仅有助于你取得成功，而且感觉非常有力量。
- en: You've done some great work in this book. You learned how the AI has changed
    over time and how each traffic source now has its own algorithm to cater to. This
    was a very important thing to learn, because it helped you take control of your
    own presence in the ecosystem rather than blaming YouTube for your failures. Now
    you know that there are opportunities aplenty—a whole world of views to capture
    and money to make. There are countless ways to interact and succeed through community,
    collaborations, brand deals, and more.

  zh: 你在这本书中做了一些很棒的工作。你了解了人工智能如何随着时间的推移而改变，以及现在每个流量来源都有自己的算法来满足需求。这是一个非常重要的事情要学习，因为它帮助你掌控自己在生态系统中的存在，而不是把失败归咎于YouTube。现在你知道，机会多得是——有整个世界的观看量可以获取，有钱可以赚。通过社区、合作、品牌交易等方式，有无数种方法可以互动和取得成功。
- en: As you move forward as a creator, align your priorities and practices with what
    YouTube wants. Put more importance on getting viewers to click or tap on your
    video, because if they don't click, they won't watch. And when you get them to
    watch one, then get them to watch another one. Think of the viewer as a person,
    not a number, so you can really get to know who they are to anticipate what they
    might want to watch. It's all about the viewer! And remember that YouTube success
    is not a lottery. Don't think that Jase and Rachel Bennett were some of the “lucky
    ones” realize that anyone can do this—including you—with the right mindset and
    tools.

  zh: 在你作为创作者的过程中，要把你的优先事项和实践与YouTube的要求保持一致。更加重视让观众点击或触摸你的视频，因为如果他们不点击，他们就不会观看。当你让他们观看一个视频时，再让他们观看另一个视频。把观众看作一个人，而不是一个数字，这样你就可以真正了解他们是谁，以预测他们可能想观看的内容。一切都是为了观众！记住，YouTube的成功不是靠运气。不要认为Jase和Rachel
    Bennett是一些“幸运儿”，要意识到任何人都可以做到这一点，包括你，只要有正确的心态和工具。
- en: I hope I have opened your eyes to the power of YouTube to change lives and businesses—it
    offers a place for every one of us to reach the whole world, no matter where we
    live or what our circumstances are. If you skin your YouTube knees, just get up,
    brush off, analyze what happened and why, then continue making great content you're
    passionate about, whether it's vlogging or quilting or building your business.
    Find your audience and speak to them. Create for them, listen to them, and never
    sacrifice your message for anyone or anything. When something isn't working, look
    at your data and make smart adjustments to give your content the best chance to
    be discovered and watched. This is the YouTube Formula. Use it, and watch the
    magic happen.
