    many YouTube “failures” over the years in order to change the things that were
    not working. I use quotation marks because I do not actually consider them failures;
    I consider them an important part of the process. It's like Thomas Edison said,
    “I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.” “Failure” is
    a harsh teacher, but it is a teacher, nonetheless, and when you begin to accept
    what you might be doing wrong, you are ready to move forward. Some YouTubers don't
    analyze why a video underperformed or they don't know what to look at. So, what
    do they do? The same thing over and over again, hoping for a different result.
    This is called insanity, and it will lead to YouTubers burning out and either
    quitting or scaling back. I've seen this happen a lot. Making a living on YouTube
    isn't easy when you don't figure out why your content is underperforming so you
    don't know how to make small tweaks to course correct.

    $20 a video. The dating website didn't work, so they changed the website to what
    its users wanted. If what you're doing hasn't been working, be willing to change
    it. Some creators who have been on YouTube a while often get trapped in old habits.
    If you fall within the “old YouTuber” category, reassess your ideology and methodology.
    Holding on to outdated processes and ideas could be what's been holding you back
    from seeing real growth. Just because something used to work for your content

  zh: 现在你已经成为数据的学生，并意识到自己可能做错了一些事情，你可以把精力放在获取反馈上。从正确的地方（不是你妈妈）获取正确的反馈是非常重要的。一些创作者错误地认为，获得任何反馈都是好的，但并非所有的反馈都是平等的。如果你从一个并不代表你理想观众的团队那里得到反馈，那么你可能会带来更多的伤害，因为他们对你的内容不感兴趣，而你的理想观众是感兴趣的。因此，当他们与你的内容互动时，他们的行为是不稳定的，会向人工智能发送错误的信息，影响你的分析数据。所以，如果你的观众主要是Z世代，你不应该从千禧一代和婴儿潮一代那里获得大部分反馈。与其从错误的来源获得反馈，不如根本不获得反馈。

    went to his mother‐in‐law and asked her the same question. She replied, “Because
    my roasting pan was too small to fit a whole pot roast.” The wife's roasting pan

    new scheduled uploads. Creators started uploading manually because they thought
    it was the only way to get around the problem. The glitch was fixed, but a lot
    of creators continued to think it was broken. They believed this for years and
    were slaves to the clock. No matter what it interfered with—sleep, day job, family
    obligations—they stuck to manual uploading. YouTube's fixed scheduling tool would

    ads on the site as display ads, search result ads, and as preroll, midroll, and
    postroll ads. When a viewer sees an ad on a video, the advertiser has been charged
    money that was taken in by YouTube and split with the creator whose video the

    or per thousand impressions.'

- en: As a creator, you can go to your revenue metrics and see how much money you
    are making from these ads playing on your videos by looking at the RPM, or revenue
    per mille/thousand, metric. According to YouTube, they pull in your total revenue
    from ads, Channel Memberships, Super Chat and Super Stickers, and YouTube Premium
    and multiply by 1,000, then they divide that by your total views in the same time
    period. This used to be an “estimated” metric, but YouTube announced the new RPM
    metric in July 2020 to show transparency and reassurance to creators as numbers
    declined from Covid‐19\. I'm glad to report that the RPM metric is no longer estimated,
    and that you don't have to do the calculating yourself. It was always an awkward

    their targeting, the more they have to shell out. For example, paying for an ad
    to be shown to “females” costs a lot less per mille for an advertiser than choosing
    “Asian females age 35–45, zip code 90210 in southern California.” They can get
    crazy specific here. They can specify their target as cat lovers, or within a

- en: Let's talk more in depth about the funnest part of YouTube with some awesome
    success stories. What's the funnest part of YouTube? Making money, of course!
    Take Dan Markham from the *What's Inside* channel, for example. He gets to hang
    out with his son and make a lot of money doing it. They cut stuff open for their
    videos, and they have made a lot of memories together over the six years they've
    been active on YouTube. Their multimillion subscriber channels provide ample income
    for the Markham family to live any lifestyle they want, but Dan remembers the
    early days of being a YouTube Partner and being excited about the tiny returns.
    His channel was making nickels and dimes in the beginning, so he remembers very
    distinctly the day when he made $4 in ad revenue … and felt excited about it.

  zh: 让我们更深入地谈谈YouTube最有趣的部分，以及一些令人惊叹的成功故事。YouTube最有趣的部分是什么？当然是赚钱！以*What's Inside*频道的丹·马克汉姆为例。他可以和儿子一起玩耍，并且赚了很多钱。他们在视频中剖开东西，六年来一直在YouTube上活跃，一起留下了很多回忆。他们的百万订阅频道为马克汉姆家庭提供了丰厚的收入，让他们可以过上任何他们想要的生活方式，但丹还记得成为YouTube合作伙伴的早期日子，对微薄的回报感到兴奋。他的频道一开始只赚了几毛钱，所以他非常清楚地记得那天他赚了4美元的广告收入……并为此感到兴奋。
- en: “I thought maybe we could put some money away for college if we had a little
    income that was coming in while we were sleeping,” Dan said. “So I started reading
    tons of articles to research how to do YouTube.” He started putting up videos
    weekly, which is all he could commit to at the time with his day job and family
    life. In four months, he reached a thousand subscribers; in three more months,
    he had a hundred thousand, and just four months later, he had a million subscribers.

  zh: “我想也许我们可以为大学存一些钱，如果我们有一些收入在我们睡觉时进账的话，”丹说。“所以我开始阅读大量的文章，研究如何做YouTube。”他开始每周上传视频，那是他在白天工作和家庭生活中能做的全部。四个月后，他获得了一千名订阅者；再过三个月，他有了十万名订阅者，仅仅四个月后，他有了一百万名订阅者。
- en: 'In those early days, Dan could see the potential for real growth with YPP AdSense,
    but he never dreamed of the domino opportunities that would be coming because
    of it. It opened up brand deals, sponsorships, and big business ideas. This would
    be exciting for someone who wasn''t making a ton of money in their regular job,
    but Dan was. He had a very comfortable, stable job that paid well, and so did
    his wife. She was a top VP at Honeywell, and they were each making six figures
    (not to mention their benefits packages). Money wasn''t a problem for the Markhams.
    So even when the YouTube channel took off and was making more than the day job,
    Dan felt uneasy about quitting something stable for something that felt like it
    might be a phase. Looking back, he can see that he could have gone full time on
    YouTube sooner, but he had to be comfortable with the idea that “stable” in a
    traditional sense can be crippling.  ### Case Study: Jackie @ JackieNerdECrafter'

    of hype and exposure from their combined online presence, and the response was
    staggering. When the palette launched, it sold one million units in 30 minutes.
    At $52 a palette, they raked in $52 million. And they could have sold a lot more
    had they not sold out. The influx of traffic crashed Shopify for hours. Star had
    estimated sales in the millions, but I would guess that even he was blown away

    so they asked Mindy how to run digital marketing. Mindy taught them about “swipe
    ups” and affiliate links. For her products specifically, Mindy wanted micro influencers
    to push her products to their own dedicated followers. She wanted online chatter
    about the product, not a meaningless, nonproductive celebrity endorsement. The
    next step after micro influencers would be to get bigger influencers with bigger
    reach to tell their audiences. Mindy's meticulous care in aesthetic design resulted
    in products that were “Instagram worthy,” meaning people would want to take a
    picture and post it. She knew it would be easier for influencers to have a bigger
    response if her products were pretty in addition to high quality.

- en: One of my favorite examples of extending reach and driving revenue on YouTube
    comes from a quilting company in Small Town, USA. Jenny and Ron Doan own the Missouri
    Star Quilting Company, whose YouTube channel has almost 700,000 subscribers in
    mid‐2020\. But in the early 1990s, before quilting was on their radar, the Doans
    were living in California, and they were down on their luck. One of their seven
    children had medical issues that required very expensive treatments. The medical
    bills crushed them. They were nearly bankrupt when they decided it was time to
    move somewhere more affordable where they could pinch pennies and get out of debt.
    They literally took out a map of the United States, closed their eyes, and pointed.
    Missouri was the winner.

  zh: 我最喜欢的一个关于扩大影响力和在YouTube上创收的例子来自美国小镇的一个缝纫公司。珍妮和罗恩·多恩拥有密苏里之星缝纫公司，他们的YouTube频道在2020年中期拥有近70万订阅者。但在90年代初，缝纫还不在他们的视野中，多恩一家住在加利福尼亚，运气不佳。他们的七个孩子中有一个需要非常昂贵的治疗。医疗费用使他们负债累累。当他们决定是时候搬到一个更实惠的地方，他们可以节省开支并摆脱债务时，他们几乎破产了。他们真的拿出了一张美国地图，闭上了眼睛，然后指了指。密苏里赢了。
- en: 'So in 1995, the Doans moved to the Midwest to a little town called Hamilton,
    Missouri. Ron got a job at a newspaper working as a mechanic, but it was a long
    commute with extended hours and many nights away from home. Jenny found odd jobs
    to help make ends meet. Unfortunately, they lost retirement savings with the stock
    market crash in 2008\. Ron''s job security felt unsure, and the Doans were down
    on their luck, yet again. Often in a small town, businesses struggle to stay afloat,
    and this was true for a lot of the shops in Hamilton at the time. Because they
    were such a small community, it felt like a personal blow every time one of them
    had to close their doors. The Doans were a big struggling family in a small struggling
    town.  ## Demand = Opportunity'

- en: Jenny was good at sewing and had been a costume seamstress in California. There
    was approximately zero demand for a costume designer in Hamilton, so someone suggested
    that she take a quilting class. Jenny's response? Quilting is for old people.
    But she did take the class, and what she discovered was that quilting took an
    incredible amount of creativity. She was hooked. Jenny was a piecer, which means
    that she put the pieces together for the top layer of the quilt. To finish the
    quilt, you needed a longarm machine that would put the quilt top, fluffy insides,
    and quilt backing together. Quilters and their machines were scarce because the
    machines were very expensive. Quilts ready to be finished had to wait in a long
    line, and Jenny's quilts were no exception.

  zh: 珍妮擅长缝纫，在加利福尼亚州曾是一名服装裁缝。汉密尔顿几乎没有对服装设计师的需求，所以有人建议她去上缝纫课。珍妮的回应是？缝制是老年人的活动。但她确实上了这门课，她发现缝制需要极大的创造力。她迷上了缝制。珍妮是一个拼布者，意味着她把拼布的顶层部分拼在一起。要完成拼布，你需要一台长臂缝纫机，它可以把拼布的顶层、蓬松的填充物和底布缝在一起。缝纫者和他们的机器很少见，因为这些机器非常昂贵。准备好被完成的拼布必须排队等候，珍妮的拼布也不例外。

    longarm sewing machine and become a quilter! The Doans went for it. They invested
    in the expensive machine, but there wasn''t room for it in their house. So they

    he was sure their business wouldn't make it. You had to be crazy to open a business
    like this in such a place! One transaction a day felt like a success to the Doans.
    They made a Facebook page and got two likes. Alan had an idea to do a “Quilter's
    Daily Deal” to sell random extras kicking around the warehouse, but quilters just
    weren't online yet. It was a hard start, because they didn't know where to find

    a lot of helpful quilting information for free. People looked forward to the email
    and wanted to share it with their other quilting friends, who also would sign
    up. It was at this point that they made a decision that would eventually transform
    their lives. Alan suggested to his mom that she should film tutorials and put

- en: 'In [Chapter 2](c02.xhtml), I talked about how ad revenue sharing changed everything
    for the YouTube ecosystem. I introduced Orabrush as an original case study of
    leveraging the power of YouTube to generate huge success. Go back and read about
    how Jeffrey Harmon, a poor college student at the time, took a product from near
    death to international distribution and millions in evergreen sales. Orabrush''s
    inventor, “Dr. Bob” Wagstaff, had tried many ways to sell his tongue‐cleaning
    brush, but nothing had worked. When a company is spending two dollars to make
    one, they get to a point where they have two options: quit, or try something totally
    new. Wagstaff chose option two and gave this marketing student the reins. YouTube
    was totally new, and Jeffrey wanted to try using it to help Dr. Bob save his invention.
    Advertisers weren''t on YouTube yet; it was a rudimentary platform to buy ads
    to send traffic to. This is why it was such a huge opportunity: there was nobody
    to compete with yet. Jeffrey enlisted the help of fellow amateur creators he knew
    to help him make a video for Orabrush for a few hundred dollars, and he put it

    from inception to launch in only three weeks. In just 21 days, they did the script
    writing, casting, shooting, editing, and ad release. That's impressive. The ad
    truly went viral. When people talk about a viral video, they are talking about
    ads like the one for PooPourri. Because of what they had learned doing Orabrush,
    the Harmon brothers had learned how to do split testing with different intros,
    outros, and lengths. In testing, William Goodman, a *Huffington Post* reporter,
    got his hands on the video, and he embedded it into the article he wrote about
    the ad called “Poopourri Spray Promises to Take the Stink Out of Public Pooping.”

- en: 'As successful as the ad was, Jeffrey said it could have gone even further and
    generated even more revenue had they been able to finish the split test. The video
    that had gone viral was titled, “How to make it so your poop doesn''t stink,”
    and testing showed that the title, “Girls don''t poop,” was performing better.
    Here''s an expert tip from Jeffrey: use the words your followers use to describe
    your brand. “Girls don''t poop” had been said several times in the comments of
    the video, so they took the phrase and turned it into the best performing version
    of the ad. “You can find your true brand message in the comments,” Jeffrey said,
    “If you aren''t using those words, you''re probably not on target.” Take it from
    Jeffrey—he''s run a successful ad or two. The Harmon brothers made a very large
    amount of money on the PooPourri campaign. (Fun fact: PooPourri asked where to
    wire the money, and the Harmon brothers didn''t even have a business account at
    a bank yet. They hurried to file as a business on their state''s website so they
    could run down to the bank and set up an account.)  ## Take Smart Risks'

    He asked the Harmon brothers to help, but he hesitated when he heard their pitch
    for an ad with a pooping unicorn. Bobby's investor said no. The investor said
    it should be a free campaign, which meant the Harmon brothers would be doing it
    pro bono. It was Jeffrey's turn to say no. He knew how valuable their skills were,
