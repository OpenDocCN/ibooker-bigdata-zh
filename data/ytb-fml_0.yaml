  zh: 前言
- en: Everyone should have a YouTube channel. Literally everyone, but especially brands.
    When I see brands that don't have a presence on YouTube, I think they're insane.
    It's unfathomable that anyone isn't capitalizing on the opportunity there. It's
    the most coveted job in America, and with good reason. It is quite literally a
    gold mine.

  zh: 每个人都应该有一个YouTube频道。真的每个人，尤其是品牌。当我看到没有在YouTube上存在的品牌时，我觉得他们疯了。任何人都不利用这个机会是难以想象的。这是美国最令人垂涎的工作，而且理由充分。它确实是一座金矿。
- en: When I was a kid, I watched YouTube all the time. It was always my dream job.
    I didn't want to be an astronaut or a doctor—I couldn't envision a world where
    I wasn't a YouTuber. I started my channel in 2012 and only got 40 subscribers
    my first year. Now I have one of the fastest growing channels in the world. I
    gained more than 15 million subscribers in 2019 alone with just over 4 billion
    video views. And it's still growing every day.

  zh: 当我还是个孩子的时候，我经常看YouTube。那总是我的梦想工作。我不想成为宇航员或医生——我无法想象一个没有成为YouTuber的世界。我2012年开始我的频道，第一年只有40个订阅者。现在我拥有世界上增长最快的频道之一。仅在2019年，我就获得了超过1500万的订阅者和超过40亿的视频观看次数。而且每天还在增长。
- en: 'If you are just getting started on YouTube, do not expect to pull any type
    of viewership in your first year. If this isn''t something you can accept, don''t
    start. But if you can, then you need to do this: make 100 videos. It doesn''t
    matter what they are because they will be terrible, but do something you like
    doing. Your first 10 videos will be garbage. Then make 10 more. These will also
    be garbage, and so will the next 10\. But eventually, things will start to improve.
    You''ll get better little by little. The best way to improve your content is to
    make content and see what people like.'

  zh: 如果你刚开始在YouTube上，不要指望在第一年就能吸引任何观众。如果你无法接受这一点，就不要开始。但如果你可以的话，你需要做到这一点：制作100个视频。这并不重要，因为它们会很糟糕，但做一些你喜欢的事情。你的前10个视频会很糟糕。然后再做10个。这些也会很糟糕，接下来的10个也是如此。但最终，事情会开始改善。你会一点点变得更好。改善内容的最佳方式就是制作内容并看看人们喜欢什么。
- en: 'Then you''ll notice something with your 101st video. It will be in a whole
    different league from your first video. You will still be a long way from good
    content, but it will be better than your first video was. It took me hundreds
    of videos over several years before I got good at it. I had been making YouTube
    videos for two years and still didn''t make good quality videos, even though I
    thought they were good at the time. I was like so many creators: I thought the
    algorithm hated me because I wasn''t getting subscribers and views. But in reality,
    my content wasn''t good enough. In fact, my videos were horrible, like most YouTube
    videos are. Most YouTubers have their priorities backward. They spend all their
    time thinking about the algorithm in their first hundred videos when they should
    really be thinking about how to make better content geared toward the viewer.'

  zh: 然后你会注意到你的第101个视频。它将与你的第一个视频完全不同。你离优质内容还有很长的路要走，但它会比你的第一个视频好。我花了几年时间制作了数百个视频，才慢慢变得更好。我制作YouTube视频已经两年了，但质量还不够好，尽管当时我觉得它们很好。我和很多创作者一样：我以为算法讨厌我，因为我没有获得订阅者和观看次数。但实际上，我的内容还不够好。事实上，我的视频很糟糕，就像大多数YouTube视频一样。大多数YouTuber把他们的优先事项搞错了。在前100个视频中，他们把所有的时间都花在思考算法上，而实际上他们应该想想如何制作更好的内容，以迎合观众。
- en: Unless you're the rare YouTuber who has created content professionally, you're
    probably average (at best) at making content. You don't go from entertaining nobody
    to entertaining millions in a day. It's hard work and a slow progressive workup,
    and it should be. Because if you got millions of viewers overnight, you wouldn't
    know how to handle them.

  zh: 除非你是那种罕见的专业制作内容的YouTuber，否则你制作内容的水平可能是平均水平（至少）。你不可能一夜之间从无人关注变成吸引数百万人的内容。这是艰苦的工作和一个缓慢的进步过程，而且应该是这样。因为如果你一夜之间获得了数百万的观众，你不会知道如何应对他们。
- en: Every video is your competitor, so you have to keep putting in the effort to
    keep your content relevant and competitive. Viewers have to pick between videos
    every time they go to YouTube, and they'll choose the better video without a second
    thought. Make your video the better video.

  zh: 每个视频都是你的竞争对手，所以你必须不断努力保持你的内容相关和有竞争力。观众每次去YouTube都必须在视频之间做出选择，他们会毫不犹豫地选择更好的视频。让你的视频成为更好的视频。
- en: If a video from your channel from six months ago doesn't make you want to barf
    because of how much better you are at making content now, you're doing it wrong.
    I can't even stand watching my videos from six months ago because I am so much
    better at making content now. I can see how bad my old videos are. They could
    have been so much better! I'm depressed even thinking about those videos.

  zh: 如果你六个月前的视频不让你想吐，因为你现在制作内容的水平要好得多，那你就错了。我甚至无法忍受看我六个月前的视频，因为我现在制作内容的水平要好得多。我能看出我的旧视频有多糟糕。它们本来可以做得更好！我甚至一想到那些视频就感到沮丧。
- en: There is a huge opportunity on YouTube for brands. If every brand knew what
    I know, they could get a hundred times the viewership they get on television for
    the same cost. They should be giving creators like me their advertising budget
    to make YouTube videos around their brand. I'll give you an example. If I was
    Coca‐Cola, I could build a pyramid of a million Coca‐Cola cans. Or I could make
    a video called, “I Filled My Friend's House with a Million Cans of Coca‐Cola.”
    These are both banger ideas that would get a ton of views if done right. (This
    was free, Coca‐Cola; next time you can pay me, lol.) Videos like these could lead
    to millions upon millions more return than TV‐spends, and it's exponentially cheaper.
    And seriously, who really watches TV commercials anyway. Everyone picks up their
    phones during commercials.

  zh: YouTube对品牌来说是一个巨大的机会。如果每个品牌都知道我知道的东西，他们可以以同样的成本获得电视观众的一百倍。他们应该把像我这样的创作者的广告预算用来制作围绕他们品牌的YouTube视频。我给你举个例子。如果我是可口可乐，我可以建一个由一百万个可口可乐罐组成的金字塔。或者我可以制作一个名为“我用一百万罐可口可乐填满了我朋友的房子”的视频。如果做得好，这两个都是绝佳的创意，会获得大量的观看次数。（这是免费的，可口可乐；下次你可以付我钱，哈哈。）这样的视频可能会带来比电视广告更多的回报，而且成本更低。而且，谁真的会看电视广告呢。每个人在广告期间都会拿起手机。
- en: If brands want to get real visibility, they have to get off of TV. What do you
    think people do—especially anyone under the age of 30—when the ads start rolling
    on TV? They pull out their phones and quit paying attention! They're not watching
    your commercial! Their attention has been moved to Twitter. SnapChat. YouTube.
    TikTok. Tweets spike during TV commercials. And people don't put their phones
    down until the commercials are over and their show or sporting event comes back
    on. Three times fewer people skip a brand deal on YouTube than they do on TV,
    because people are usually watching from their phones. They don't have a second
    phone to grab when they come across an ad or brand deal on YouTube, so they watch
    it. And they're watching a YouTuber they watch all the time, so they are also
    less likely to skip because they trust these YouTubers.

  zh: 如果品牌想要获得真正的可见度，他们必须摆脱电视。你认为人们会怎么做——尤其是30岁以下的人——当电视上开始播放广告？他们拿出手机，不再关注！他们不看你的商业广告！他们的注意力已经转移到了Twitter、SnapChat、YouTube、TikTok。电视广告期间推特的数量激增。人们直到广告结束并且他们的节目或体育赛事重新开始之前才会放下手机。在YouTube上，比起电视，有三分之一的人会跳过品牌合作，因为人们通常是在手机上观看。当他们在YouTube上看到广告或品牌合作时，他们不会拿起第二部手机，所以他们会观看。而且他们一直在观看的YouTuber，所以他们也不太可能跳过，因为他们信任这些YouTuber。
- en: I have more eyeballs on my content every week than the Super Bowl. And I have
    a personal connection with my viewers who have built trust in me. This audience
    trust value is worth so much more than an impersonal celebrity or athlete appearance
    in a TV commercial. Brands shell out more than $5 million for 30 seconds crammed
    in with a bunch of other ads during the Super Bowl. With YouTubers like me, you
    could get 10 to 15 minutes of undivided attention centered on your brand for way
    cheaper. Then you can get the viewers to go watch more videos and interact with
    your brand in other ways if you're really smart about it. It's a no‐brainer. You're
    quite literally insane if you're not capitalizing on the opportunity here.

  zh: 我的内容每周的观众比超级碗还要多。而且我与我的观众建立了个人联系，他们对我建立了信任。这种观众信任价值远比电视商业广告中的冷漠名人或运动员出现要有价值得多。品牌在超级碗期间花费超过500万美元，来在一大堆其他广告中挤进30秒的时间。而与像我这样的YouTuber合作，你可以以更便宜的价格获得10到15分钟的关注度，集中在你的品牌上。然后，如果你真的聪明，你可以让观众观看更多视频，并以其他方式与你的品牌互动。这是毫无疑问的。如果你不利用这个机会，那你就真的疯了。
- en: Business execs think they know more than the YouTuber, especially if the YouTuber
    is very young. They want to control their integration, giving YouTubers a list
    of talking points to read verbatim with a call to action at the end. While this
    works to an extent, brands would convert exponentially more and see greater brand
    awareness and exposure if they let the YouTubers be themselves. A brand *should*
    say, “Here's a bunch of money, do what you do to connect with your viewers … as
    you've done on literally hundreds of videos with hundreds of millions of views.
    Do what you think would work best to get our brand talked about or our product
    sold. We trust you.”

  zh: 商业高管认为他们比YouTuber更懂行，尤其是如果YouTuber非常年轻。他们想要控制整合，给YouTuber一份要逐字阅读的谈话要点清单，并在最后呼吁行动。虽然这在一定程度上有效，但如果让YouTuber做自己，品牌将会获得更多的转化率，以及更大的品牌知名度和曝光度。品牌*应该*说：“这里有一大笔钱，做你擅长的事情来与你的观众建立联系……就像你在数百个视频中所做的那样，这些视频已经获得了数亿的观看次数。做你认为最有效的事情来让我们的品牌被谈论或者销售我们的产品。我们信任你。”
- en: Brands who give the creative license to YouTubers and let them talk naturally
    like they normally would with their audience are getting more brand exposure and
    ROI than they could in any other way, guaranteed. And they should quit focusing
    on views but on what kind of impression they left. Will they remember you? Or
    will they hear another sleazy sales pitch?

- en: Let me give you an example of the power of a YouTuber. I created an app called
    Finger On the App. I announced on my Instagram, Twitter, and SnapChat that everyone
    who downloaded and put their “finger on the app” at a certain time would have
    the chance to win $25,000\. All you had to do was be the last person with your
    finger still on the app. The app was only available on iPhones and only in America.
    Even with these limitations, and without even trying, I had 1.5 million people
    install the app. I hadn't even promoted it on my YouTube channel, which at the
    time had more than 37 million subscribers. In contrast, a newcomer to the mobile
    video world, Quibi, launched around the same time as my app, but they had a $1.7
    billion budget. Guess how many installs they got? Only 300,000 on the first day.

  zh: 让我给你举个YouTuber的力量的例子。我创建了一个叫做Finger On the App的应用。我在我的Instagram、Twitter和SnapChat上宣布，每个在特定时间下载并把手指放在应用上的人都有机会赢得25000美元。你所要做的就是成为最后一个手指还在应用上的人。这个应用只能在iPhone上使用，而且只在美国有。即使有这些限制，甚至没有努力推广，我也有150万人安装了这个应用。当时我的YouTube频道订阅者超过3700万，我甚至没有在上面宣传过。相比之下，移动视频新手Quibi在我发布应用的同时推出，但他们有17亿美元的预算。猜猜他们第一天得到了多少安装？只有30万。
- en: Finger On the App was inherently cool, so people talked about it. It naturally
    went viral. This is how businesses should pitch things. Change your mentality
    from wanting to get the most views to wanting to be the most talked about. My
    app was trending everywhere. I created a social footprint. And it all happened
    because I owned the app myself and had the control to spread the message my way.
    Brands come along and think they know better, but they would be so much more successful
    if they let YouTubers do what they do best. We know how to go viral. We know this
    digital world inherently because it's what we've lived and breathed our whole
    lives. We know how to get your brand talked about naturally. This is way more
    powerful than a pointless view.
