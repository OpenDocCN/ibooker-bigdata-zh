  zh: 1.1 什么是统计思维？
- en: Statistical thinking is a way of understanding a complex world by describing
    it in relatively simple terms that nonetheless capture essential aspects of its
    structure or function, and that also provide us some idea of how uncertain we
    are about that knowledge. The foundations of statistical thinking come primarily
    from mathematics and statistics, but also from computer science, psychology, and
    other fields of study.

  zh: 统计思维是一种通过相对简单的方式描述复杂世界的方式，这种方式能够捕捉其结构或功能的基本方面，并且也能够让我们对这些知识的不确定性有一些了解。统计思维的基础主要来自数学和统计学，但也来自计算机科学、心理学和其他研究领域。
- en: We can distinguish statistical thinking from other forms of thinking that are
    less likely to describe the world accurately. In particular, human intuition often
    tries to answer the same questions that we can answer using statistical thinking,
    but often gets the answer wrong. For example, in recent years most Americans have
    reported that they think that violent crime was worse compared to the previous
    year ([Pew Research Center](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/30/5-facts-about-crime-in-the-u-s/)).
    However, a statistical analysis of the actual crime data shows that in fact violent
    crime has steadily *decreased* since the 1990’s. Intuition fails us because we
    rely upon best guesses (which psychologists refer to as *heuristics*) that can
    often get it wrong. For example, humans often judge the prevalence of some event
    (like violent crime) using an *availability heuristic* – that is, how easily can
    we think of an example of violent crime. For this reason, our judgments of increasing
    crime rates may be more reflective of increasing news coverage, in spite of an
    actual decrease in the rate of crime. Statistical thinking provides us with the
    tools to more accurately understand the world and overcome the biases of human
    judgment

  zh: 我们可以区分统计思维与其他不太可能准确描述世界的思维形式。特别是，人类直觉经常试图回答我们可以用统计思维回答的相同问题，但通常得到错误的答案。例如，近年来，大多数美国人报告说他们认为暴力犯罪比前一年更糟（[皮尤研究中心](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/30/5-facts-about-crime-in-the-u-s/)）。然而，对实际犯罪数据的统计分析显示，事实上自1990年代以来，暴力犯罪一直在稳步*下降*。直觉会让我们失望，因为我们依赖于最佳猜测（心理学家称之为*启发式*），这往往会出错。例如，人类经常使用*可得性启发式*来判断某些事件（如暴力犯罪）的普遍性——也就是说，我们能多容易地想到一个暴力犯罪的例子。因此，我们对犯罪率增加的判断可能更多地反映了新闻报道的增加，而不是实际犯罪率的下降。统计思维为我们提供了更准确地理解世界的工具，并克服了人类判断的偏见。

    anxiety, especially once they hear that they will also have to learn to code in
    order to analyze data. In my class I give students a survey prior to the first
    session in order to measure their attitude towards statistics, asking them to
    rate a number of statements on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly
    agree). One of the items on the survey is “The thought of being enrolled in a
    statistics course makes me nervous”. In a recent class, almost two-thirds of the
    class responded with a five or higher, and about one-fourth of the students said
    that they strongly agreed with the statement. So if you feel nervous about starting
    to learn statistics, you are not alone.

    that people were followed. People were followed for a *median* of 7.4 years, meaning

- en: 'This plot is based on ten numbers. To obtain these numbers, the researchers
    split the group of 135,335 study participants (which we call the “sample”) into
    5 groups (“quintiles”) after ordering them in terms of their intake of either
    of the nutrients; the first quintile contains the 20% of people with the lowest
    intake, and the 5th quintile contains the 20% with the highest intake. The researchers
    then computed how often people in each of those groups died during the time they
    were being followed. The figure expresses this in terms of the *relative risk*
    of dying in comparison to the lowest quintile: If this number is greater than
    one, it means that people in the group are *more* likely to die than are people
    in the lowest quintile, whereas if it’s less than one, it means that people in
    the group are *less* likely to die. The figure is pretty clear: People who ate
    more saturated fat were *less* likely to die during the study, with the lowest
    death rate seen for people who were in the fourth quintile (that is, who ate more
    fat than the lowest 60% but less than the top 20%). The opposite is seen for carbohydrates;
    the more carbs a person ate, the more likely they were to die during the study.
    This example shows how we can use statistics to *describe* a complex dataset in
    terms of a much simpler set of numbers; if we had to look at the data from each
    of the study participants at the same time, we would be overloaded with data and
    it would be hard to see the pattern that emerges when they are described more
    simply.'

  zh: 这个图是基于十个数字。为了获得这些数字，研究人员将135,335名研究参与者（我们称之为“样本”）按其摄入任一营养素的顺序分成5组（“五分位数”）；第一分位数包含摄入最低的20%的人，第五分位数包含摄入最高的20%的人。然后研究人员计算了在随访期间每个组的人死亡的频率。图表达了这一点，以相对风险的形式，与最低分位数相比死亡的频率：如果这个数字大于一，意味着该组的人比最低分位数的人更有可能死亡，而如果小于一，意味着该组的人比最低分位数的人更不可能死亡。图表明得很清楚：摄入更多饱和脂肪的人在研究期间死亡的可能性*更低*，最低死亡率出现在摄入脂肪低于最低60%但低于最高20%的人中。而碳水化合物则相反；一个人摄入的碳水化合物越多，在研究期间死亡的可能性就越大。这个例子展示了我们如何使用统计学来用一组更简单的数字*描述*一个复杂的数据集；如果我们必须同时查看每个研究参与者的数据，我们将被数据淹没，很难看到当它们更简单地描述时所呈现的模式。
- en: The numbers in Figure [1.1](introduction.html#fig:PureDeathSatFat) seem to show
    that deaths decrease with saturated fat and increase with carbohydrate intake,
    but we also know that there is a lot of uncertainty in the data; there are some
    people who died early even though they ate a low-carb diet, and, similarly, some
    people who ate a ton of carbs but lived to a ripe old age. Given this variability,
    we want to *decide* whether the relationships that we see in the data are large
    enough that we wouldn’t expect them to occur randomly if there was not truly a
    relationship between diet and longevity. Statistics provide us with the tools
    to make these kinds of decisions, and often people from the outside view this
    as *the* main purpose of statistics. But as we will see throughout the book, this
    need for black-and-white decisions based on fuzzy evidence has often led researchers

    For example, a life insurance company might want to use data about a particular
    person’s intake of fat and carbohydrate to predict how long they are likely to
    live. An important aspect of prediction is that it requires us to generalize from
    the data we already have to some other situation, often in the future; if our
    conclusions were limited to the specific people in the study at a particular time,
    then the study would not be very useful. In general, researchers must assume that
    their particular sample is representative of a larger *population*, which requires
    that they obtain the sample in a way that provides an unbiased picture of the
    population. For example, if the PURE study had recruited all of its participants
    from religious sects that practice vegetarianism, then we probably wouldn’t want
    to generalize the results to people who follow different dietary standards.

    with the expectation that eating more fat would lead to higher death rates, given
    the prevailing negative dogma about saturated fats. Later in the course we will
    introduce the idea of *prior knowledge*, which is meant to reflect the knowledge
    that we bring to a situation. This prior knowledge can vary in its strength, often
    based on our amount of experience; if I visit a restaurant for the first time,
    I am likely to have a weak expectation of how good it will be, but if I visit
    a restaurant where I have eaten ten times before, my expectations will be much
    stronger. Similarly, if I look at a restaurant review site and see that a restaurant’s
    average rating of four stars is only based on three reviews, I will have a weaker

    the population, as long as those samples are obtained in the right way. For example,
    the PURE study enrolled a sample of about 135,000 people, but its goal was to
    provide insights about the billions of humans who make up the population from
    which those people were sampled. As we already discussed above, the way that the

    the results. Another fundamental insight about sampling is that while larger samples
    are always better (in terms of their ability to accurately represent the entire
    population), there are diminishing returns as the sample gets larger. In fact,
    the rate at which the benefit of larger samples decreases follows a simple mathematical
    rule, growing as the square root of the sample size, such that in order to double
    the precision of our estimate we need to quadruple the size of our sample.

- en: 'The PURE study seemed to provide pretty strong evidence for a positive relationship
    between eating saturated fat and living longer, but this doesn’t tell us what
    we really want to know: If we eat more saturated fat, will that cause us to live
    longer? This is because we don’t know whether there is a direct causal relationship
    between eating saturated fat and living longer. The data are consistent with such
    a relationship, but they are equally consistent with some other factor causing
    both higher saturated fat and longer life. For example, one might imagine that
    people who are richer eat more saturated fat and richer people tend to live longer,
    but their longer life is not necessarily due to fat intake — it could instead
    be due to better health care, reduced psychological stress, better food quality,
    or many other factors. The PURE study investigators tried to account for these
    factors, but we can’t be certain that their efforts completely removed the effects
    of other variables. The fact that other factors may explain the relationship between
    saturated fat intake and death is an example of why introductory statistics classes
    often teach that “correlation does not imply causation”, though the renowned data
    visualization expert Edward Tufte has added, “but it sure is a hint.”'

  zh: PURE研究似乎提供了关于饱和脂肪摄入与长寿之间积极关系的相当强有力的证据，但这并不能告诉我们我们真正想知道的：如果我们摄入更多饱和脂肪，那会让我们活得更久吗？这是因为我们不知道摄入饱和脂肪和长寿之间是否存在直接因果关系。数据与这种关系一致，但它们同样也与其他因素导致了更高的饱和脂肪和更长的寿命。例如，人们可能会想象富人吃更多饱和脂肪，富人更长寿，但他们更长的寿命不一定是由于脂肪摄入
    - 它可能是由于更好的医疗保健，减少的心理压力，更好的食品质量或许多其他因素。PURE研究的调查人员试图考虑这些因素，但我们不能确定他们的努力是否完全消除了其他变量的影响。其他因素可能解释了饱和脂肪摄入与死亡之间的关系，这就是为什么入门统计课程经常教导“相关不意味着因果关系”，尽管著名的数据可视化专家爱德华·图夫特补充说：“但这确实是一个暗示。”
- en: Although observational research (like the PURE study) cannot conclusively demonstrate
    causal relations, we generally think that causation can be demonstrated using
    studies that experimentally control and manipulate a specific factor. In medicine,
    such a study is referred to as a *randomized controlled trial* (RCT). Let’s say
    that we wanted to do an RCT to examine whether increasing saturated fat intake
    increases life span. To do this, we would sample a group of people, and then assign
    them to either a treatment group (which would be told to increase their saturated
    fat intake) or a control group (who would be told to keep eating the same as before).
    It is essential that we assign the individuals to these groups randomly. Otherwise,
    people who choose the treatment might be different in some way than people who
    choose the control group – for example, they might be more likely to engage in
    other healthy behaviors as well. We would then follow the participants over time
    and see how many people in each group died. Because we randomized the participants
    to treatment or control groups, we can be reasonably confident that there are
    no other differences between the groups that would *confound* the treatment effect;
    however, we still can’t be certain because sometimes randomization yields treatment
    versus control groups that *do* vary in some important way. Researchers often
    try to address these confounds using statistical analyses, but removing the influence
    of a confound from the data can be very difficult.

  zh: 尽管观察研究（如PURE研究）不能最终证明因果关系，我们通常认为可以使用实验控制和操纵特定因素的研究来证明因果关系。在医学上，这样的研究被称为*随机对照试验*（RCT）。假设我们想进行一项RCT来研究增加饱和脂肪摄入是否会延长寿命。为此，我们将对一组人进行抽样，然后将他们分配到治疗组（被告知增加饱和脂肪摄入）或对照组（被告知保持与以前相同的饮食）。我们必须将这些个体随机分配到这些组中。否则，选择治疗的人可能在某种程度上与选择对照组的人不同
    - 例如，他们可能更有可能参与其他健康行为。然后，我们将随着时间跟踪参与者，并观察每组有多少人死亡。因为我们将参与者随机分配到治疗或对照组，我们可以相当有信心地认为两组之间没有其他差异会*混淆*治疗效果；然而，我们仍然不能确定，因为有时随机化会产生在某些重要方面*确实*有所不同的治疗与对照组。研究人员通常尝试使用统计分析来解决这些混淆，但从数据中消除混淆的影响可能非常困难。
- en: 'A number of RCTs have examined the question of whether changing saturated fat
    intake results in better health and longer life. These trials have focused on
    *reducing* saturated fat because of the strong dogma amongst nutrition researchers
    that saturated fat is deadly; most of these researchers would have probably argued
    that it was not ethical to cause people to eat *more* saturated fat! However,
    the RCTs have shown a very consistent pattern: Overall there is no appreciable
    effect on death rates of reducing saturated fat intake.'

  zh: 许多RCT已经研究了改变饱和脂肪摄入是否会导致更健康和更长寿的问题。这些试验主要关注*减少*饱和脂肪，因为营养研究人员中存在着饱和脂肪是致命的强烈教条；大多数这些研究人员可能会认为导致人们摄入*更多*饱和脂肪是不道德的！然而，这些RCT已经显示了非常一致的模式：总体上减少饱和脂肪摄入对死亡率没有明显影响。
