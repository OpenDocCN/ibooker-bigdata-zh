  zh: 一个神奇的冰淇淋拉屎的独角兽让我写下了这本书。这不是它开始的地方，但这是推动我走向极端的原因。如果你觉得这让我听起来有点疯狂，让我解释一下。
- en: It was 1999\. I had recently graduated with a degree in advertising and marketing,
    and I had a stable job with benefits and potential for advancement. But then …
    I quit. It wasn't the right career path for me. I wanted to start my own business
    and create my own future. This felt crazy because my wife and I had our first
    baby, Ellie, that year, and I felt the pressure to provide for my family. Keeping
    a steady job and building savings would have been the safe thing to do, but instead,
    I spent all our money on the latest Macintosh computer and the software it needed
    (it would have been cheaper to go with a PC! Dang you, Steve Jobs). I was determined
    to be a successful business owner and ready to take on the world … from my kitchen
    table workstation at home.

  zh: 那是1999年。我刚刚获得了广告营销学位，有了一份稳定的有福利和晋升机会的工作。但后来……我辞职了。那不是适合我的职业道路。我想要开创自己的事业，创造自己的未来。这让我感到疯狂，因为那一年我和妻子迎来了我们的第一个孩子艾莉，我感到了为家庭提供的压力。保持一份稳定的工作并储蓄本来是安全的选择，但我却把所有的钱都花在了最新的麦金塔电脑和所需的软件上（如果选择PC的话可能会更便宜！该死的史蒂夫·乔布斯）。我决心要成为一个成功的企业主，准备好迎接世界……在家里的厨房桌子工作站上。

    my own business card. I just knew I would be a great entrepreneur. But after only
    two weeks, my wife, Carolyn, let me know that my office needed to move from the
    family table where she fed the baby and where there were spills aplenty. She had
    gotten a degree in accounting and had a really good job and had put me through
    school, but we both wanted her to be able to stay home with Ellie and our future
    children. Carolyn was my business partner—she did payroll, invoicing, and bookkeeping.
    We discussed where the company was going and how we could get money coming in.
    I needed to find clients to start bringing in the money so Carolyn wouldn't have
    to go back to work.

  zh: 我花了几天时间整理我的公司信息，设计网站，制作自己的名片。我知道我会成为一个伟大的企业家。但仅仅两周后，我的妻子卡罗琳告诉我，我的办公室需要从家庭餐桌搬走，她在那里喂孩子，那里经常发生溅洒。她拥有会计学位，有一份非常好的工作，还资助我上学，但我们都希望她能够留在家里照顾艾莉和我们未来的孩子。卡罗琳是我的商业伙伴——她负责工资、发票和簿记。我们讨论了公司的发展方向以及如何让钱进账。我需要找到客户开始赚钱，这样卡罗琳就不用回去工作了。
- en: My first order of business, though, was to move my work space. This took me
    to Staples to buy a desk for my computer. I was admiring all the things I wanted
    for my new business, walking down the aisle with color laser printers. If only
    I could convince my business partner‐wife that I needed to buy one of these beauties!
    A fancy printer could help me show future clients work samples for ads I could
    make for them. My tech‐geek daydream was interrupted by a man asking me a question
    about printers. He introduced himself as Chuck and was wondering if I could help
    him with picking a color printer. I explained the difference between the two printers
    in question because I knew all their specs—these were printers I wanted to buy
    for my business, too. I didn't have the money for a printer because I didn't have
    any clients. I recommended the more expensive printer because of its print capabilities
    and less expensive toner. He said, “I've been coming to Staples for years, and
    you are the best employee I've ever talked to.” I informed him that I didn't work
    for Staples (which surprised him because I was wearing a red polo shirt and khakis—the
    classic Staples employee outfit). “Are you sure?” he asked. I convinced him by
    telling my story about starting my own business doing graphic design and websites.
    Wouldn't you know, he had recently started his own company called 1001 Business
    Cards and was looking for a designer. He hired me and my company on the spot to
    design his website and business cards. How serendipitous! I walked out of that
    Staples with a desk for $200 and a check for $300 from my first client, a $100
    net profit. “That was easy!” in true Staples fashion. Owning a business was going
    to be a walk in the park.

    你知道你的问题是什么吗？
- en: 'I went to see my dad to ask his advice. My dad had owned several businesses
    and done a lot of real estate ventures, and he had been successful at both. He
    gave me some simple advice, but it was some of the best advice I''ve ever received.
    He said, “You need to find a way to make more money with less time and with diverse
    streams of income.” That was his standard way: he would always restate my problem
    before giving me fatherly advice. “Derral, don''t think of solutions, think of
    the problem. When you focus and obsess on the problem, the solution will present
    itself.” Take a minute and let that soak in. Einstein believed that our ability
    to identify problems was in direct proportion to the quality of the solutions
    we generate. He said, “If I had an hour to solve a problem I''d spend 55 minutes
    thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking about solutions.” I believed
    Einstein''s words, but I really trusted my dad.'

- en: As an independent graphic designer, I created new business cards for my only
    client, Chuck, at 1001 Business Cards. He paid me $10 a card. Normally, I would
    have had zero contact with those businesses ordering cards. Chuck would get a
    new client, collect their logo, their picture, and their design requirements,
    and send them to me. I would design their card and email it to Chuck. After client
    approval, Chuck would have the cards printed and delivered. There was no reason
    why I would have interacted with these businesses. But now I had a plan to diversify.
    I wanted to sell them a five‐page website design package for $299\. I started
    cold calling these businesses with my offer. After spending a week calling every
    business card that I had designed, there were only two takers out of 200 calls.

- en: I needed a new plan, so I refocused on the problem. I analyzed my talking points,
    learning from my telemarketing experience. I devised a new strategy that would
    take the process from a cold call to a warm lead, but it meant I needed to meet
    with these people in person. I asked Chuck if I could hand deliver the completed
    business cards to these businesses and offer my further services for ads and websites.
    He gave me the thumbs up and go‐ahead, which landed me the opportunity to meet

    that would have taken a lot of effort for a website but showed up easily in the
    results in a matter of hours when I used videos. *Crazy!* To make sure this wasn''t
    a fluke, I tried it with a second business, a personal injury attorney. We got
    the same results: a high Google ranking and the phone ringing with leads.'

  zh: 就在那时，我注意到了一些客户数据中的模式。还记得我为他们的网站制作并嵌入的865个视频吗？其中大多数都在谷歌的首页上，没有任何黑客或帮助。哇！你的意思是，我不需要与马特·卡茨作斗争？我也不需要接到客户的疯狂电话？我加入！我所需要做的就是制作搜索友好的视频。所以我制定了一项攻击计划。我为几家精选企业制作了一系列视频，并专注于产生潜在客户。我的姐夫是一名验光师，我请他让我用视频来营销他的业务。我能够在几个小时内用视频轻松获得一些艰难的关键词排名，而这对于网站来说需要付出很大的努力才能实现。*太疯狂了！*为了确保这不是偶然现象，我尝试了第二家企业，一家人身伤害律师事务所。我们得到了相同的结果：高谷歌排名和电话响起的潜在客户。
- en: 'I had done it; I had solved one of the biggest problems for my company, and
    I wanted to go all in on video and YouTube. I needed to become the expert helping
    businesses by generating leads and sales with video. I kept my big clients who
    were paying thousands of dollars a month, but I sold everything else. It was my
    point of no return. Like when Spanish commander Cortés sank his ships and conquered
    the Aztecs. In sinking the ships, he gave himself one option: succeed or die.
    There would be no means to turn back. Likewise, I sold all my website and Internet
    marketing clients to an SEO company in Salt Lake City, with the clause that I
    could keep all the video marketing work. They agreed because they didn''t know
    what I knew, that videos ranked in Google without any blackhat hack or strategy.
    They were being promoted because YouTube was owned by Google. Google wanted videos
    to be found, so they moved more users to YouTube. So I shifted my focus from website
    creation and marketing to video creation and marketing … and I watched my clients''
    rankings and revenue skyrocket because these videos were ranking on page one of
    Google.'

  zh: 我做到了；我解决了我公司的一个最大问题，并且我想全力投入视频和YouTube。我需要成为专家，通过视频帮助企业产生潜在客户和销售。我保留了那些每月支付数千美元的大客户，但卖掉了其他一切。这是我无法回头的时刻。就像西班牙指挥官科尔特斯（Cortés）沉没了他的船只并征服了阿兹特克人一样。沉没船只给了他一个选择：成功或死亡。没有回头的余地。同样，我将所有的网站和互联网营销客户卖给了盐湖城的一家SEO公司，并附加了一个条款，即我可以保留所有视频营销工作。他们同意了，因为他们不知道我知道的，即视频在谷歌上排名，而没有任何黑帽黑客或策略。它们得到推广是因为YouTube是谷歌的子公司。谷歌希望视频被发现，因此他们将更多的用户转移到了YouTube。因此，我将注意力从网站创建和营销转移到了视频创建和营销……我看着我的客户的排名和收入因为这些视频在谷歌的第一页上而飙升。
- en: 'By this time, I was itching with excitement for what I was witnessing in the
    evolution of marketing: online video was going to be a big deal, and I wanted
    to be a part of it. Video power outweighed word power by an overwhelming margin.
    Viewers were much more likely to do what advertisers wanted them to do—pick up
    the phone and call, make a purchase, or sign up for a service—after watching a
    video. And these videos could be made by regular people who were getting incredible
    distribution to millions of viewers … using inexpensive camera equipment. This
    had never been done outside the realm of television studios and movie sets.'

  zh: 到了这个时候，我对我所见证的营销演变感到兴奋：在线视频将成为一件大事，而我想成为其中的一部分。视频的力量远远超过文字的力量。观众在观看视频后更有可能做广告商希望他们做的事情——拿起电话打电话、购买商品或注册服务。而这些视频可以由普通人用廉价的摄像设备制作。这在电视台和电影片场之外从未发生过。
- en: In my videos, I hyperfocused to dial in messaging with the goal of getting the
    phone to ring. It was so important to know everything about the person making
    the phone call. I would grill my brother‐in‐law and his office staff on all the
    things people would ask and what they needed help with. Then I would take those
    questions and turn them into talking points for the video with clear solutions
    on how we could help. I asked a ton of questions to get a good handle on the niche
    and what would work. Then I would make 10 solid videos that would show up in search.
    Once the messaging was working—the video was ranking and the phone was ringing—I
    would go to another city and do it all over again. (I only worked with one business
    per niche in each city.)

- en: One day I got a phone call from one of my clients, Wade Beatty, who had a lead
    for me. Wade owned a local pest control company, and I had done some successful
    video marketing for him. He had gone to spray a piano store for cockroaches, and
    the store owner asked if he knew anybody who did YouTube, websites, and marketing.
    Wade said, “You have to talk to Derral.” So I talked with the store owner, Paul
    Anderson, who showed me the amazing videos they were making to try to sell expensive
    pianos. They put grand pianos in beautiful locations outside—on top of mountains,
    in the desert, in a forest—and the music videos were amazing.

  zh: 有一天，我接到了我的一个客户韦德·比蒂的电话，他给我介绍了一个潜在客户。韦德拥有一家当地的杀虫公司，我为他做了一些成功的视频营销。他去给一家钢琴店喷洒杀虫剂，店主问他是否认识做YouTube、网站和营销的人。韦德说：“你必须和德雷尔谈谈。”于是我和店主保罗·安德森交谈，他向我展示了他们制作的惊人视频，试图销售昂贵的钢琴。他们把三角钢琴放在美丽的户外场所——山顶上、沙漠中、森林里——音乐视频非常棒。
- en: I asked Paul what his goals were with his store “ThePianoGuys.” He told me he
    wanted to make enough money from his YouTube videos that he didn't have to work
    at the store anymore. He didn't actually want to sell pianos, he wanted to make
    awesome videos that people would love. With the talent of Jon Schmidt at the piano,
    Steven Sharp Nelson on the cello, Al van der Beek producing the music, and Tel
    Stewart doing the videography and editing, they had the recipe for success. Their
    musical passion turned into a channel, and the channel turned into a business
    that was making so much money that they didn't need the store anymore.

    and had over a hundred million video views. They had developed a passionate, dedicated
    audience. (They never sold a single piano! But they did sell out stadiums worldwide.)
    This success shifted my focus 100% to working with creators to help them build

    It didn't have to be confined to a geographical location like my previous work

    about more than the business. You could find passionate followers in every corner
    of the Internet and bring them together around your content. This was about more
    than generating leads. It was the perfect crossover between money and passion,
    something I had been missing all those years leading up to this moment. I had
    learned a lot about algorithms and rankings and the mechanisms that worked, but
    now I could see the other side of the coin. Creating content to inspire, educate,
    or entertain was the missing link. Everything I had learned about algorithms,
    people, and messaging came together in this new moment of clarity. Audience development
