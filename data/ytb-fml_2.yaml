    by eBay for $1.5 billion. This created a lot of buzz in Silicon Valley. Ideas
    were being tossed around for websites, apps, and platforms that could possibly
    bring in a lot of money and transform the world into a digital money‐making giant.
    Three PayPal employees, Jawed Karim, Chad Hurley, and Steven Chen, were some of

    Karim、Chad Hurley和Steven Chen就是这些创意的提出者之一。他们很快想出了YouTube网站的主意，但它与我们今天熟悉的网站完全不同——他们最初将其作为一个约会网站。

    “Me at the zoo.” It was 19 seconds of Karim at the San Diego Zoo talking about
    the elephants. If you go and watch it now, you'll laugh because you know he was
    trying to get the website to be a place to find a date, and he makes an innuendo

    a natural ecosystem: there are a lot of moving parts, and all of those parts affect
    the organization as a whole. Grade‐school science taught us about energy flow

- en: 'Here''s a quick summary of how the YouTube ecosystem works: creators make videos
    and upload them to YouTube. Brands pay YouTube to run advertising alongside uploaded
    content, either before or during a video. When a channel meets the ad sharing
    program requirements, it gets a cut of the money from the ads running on their
    content. Brands also connect with creators who they think will be able to increase
    brand awareness and/or their bottom line. This influencer marketing is a huge
    part of YouTube''s ecosystem. The viewers come to interact with content, creators,
    and communities. They watch, subscribe, comment, like and dislike, save, and share.
    YouTube as a website is the host of the ecosystem, but as a company, it''s a part
    of the ecosystem. YouTube the company has to make sure everyone in the ecosystem
    is satisfied. They field complaints and legalities. They ultimately make the rules,
    but the rules evolve over time based on feedback from the ecosystem and what needs
    to be addressed. MCNs played an important role in the beginning of YouTube, connecting
    brands with creators and managing other elements of the creator experience. They
    also helped try to problem‐solve because YouTube didn''t have the creator support
    at the time. Creators don''t have to work with MCNs; they can manage their own
    channels and deal directly with brands or work with agencies to connect with brands.
    Finally, copyright holders want their original work attributed to them without
    being stolen or copied. They want to keep any financial benefit from that content
    coming back to their original content.'

  zh: 以下是YouTube生态系统运作方式的简要概述：创作者制作视频并上传到YouTube。品牌支付YouTube在上传的内容旁边或视频播放期间播放广告。当频道符合广告分成计划的要求时，它可以从其内容上播放的广告中获得一部分收入。品牌还与他们认为能够增加品牌知名度和/或底线的创作者联系。这种影响者营销是YouTube生态系统的重要组成部分。观众来与内容、创作者和社区互动。他们观看、订阅、评论、点赞和点踩、保存和分享。YouTube作为一个网站是生态系统的主持者，但作为一家公司，它是生态系统的一部分。YouTube公司必须确保生态系统中的每个人都满意。他们处理投诉和法律事务。他们最终制定规则，但这些规则会随着时间的推移根据生态系统的反馈和需要进行调整。MCNs在YouTube的初期发挥了重要作用，连接品牌和创作者，并管理创作者体验的其他元素。他们还帮助解决问题，因为当时YouTube没有创作者支持。创作者不必与MCNs合作；他们可以管理自己的频道，并直接与品牌合作或与代理机构合作联系品牌。最后，版权持有者希望他们的原创作品得到归属，而不被盗用或复制。他们希望任何来自该内容的经济利益都能回到他们的原创内容。
- en: 'To be a part of this digital ecosystem, understand the role each contributor
    plays, especially the role you intend to occupy. For example, if you are a creator,

    to use clips of scenes or songs or any other copyrighted material, know how to
    go about it legally. Your content''s success depends on your understanding your
    role in the ecosystem. Your YouTube experience should be more than starting a
    channel and uploading videos. In fact, if this is your methodology, your video

    Lawsuits. Shut down. No surprises here. Actually, just before Napster was created,
    Bill Clinton, then‐president of the United States, had signed the Digital Millennium
    Copyright Act (DMCA) into law in 1998\. The DMCA has regulated digital copyright
    issues and reinforced offender penalties ever since. (However, websites hosted

    content off the site after a copyright owner had requested it, but there was nothing

    Google had pioneered advertisement revenue sharing with its AdSense program, and
    they implemented that program with YouTube. They took it to another level going
    from display ads to video ads, because video ads were more effective. They could
    charge advertisers more money for video ads, so YouTube made more money this way.

  zh: 作为当代YouTube用户，我们已经习惯了网站自动提供我们喜欢的内容，但情况并不总是这样。最初，YouTube主要是一个寻找问题答案的地方，比如如何换轮胎，以及一个娱乐场所，比如观看猫弹钢琴或者笑看孩子们的视频，比如“查理咬了我的手指”。它建立在一个简单的系统上，不擅长推荐。但如今的YouTube拥有一个复杂的机器学习系统，非常擅长猜测人们想要什么。让我们更近距离地看看它的人工智能如何随着时间的推移而改变，以及为什么这对你很重要。

    get people to stay on the platform longer. A YouTube researcher working on this
    issue found some gaping holes in the framework. For example, a huge portion of
    YouTube viewers had gone mobile by then, and YouTube didn''t have an accurate
    system for tracking user behavior on mobile devices. Palm to face. There was work

    up‐next videos that were ready to load after the video being watched was over.
    There was an initial increase in views, but soon they plateaued. They got the
    same results from a follow‐up AI program called Sibyl.

- en: YouTube joined forces with Google Brain, Google's machine learning team, whose
    AI development and tools were leaps ahead of the field. Their goal was to build
    a system with the Google Brain foundation. Their main objective continued to be
    viewer longevity. On March 15, 2012, YouTube made the switch from a “View” algorithm
    that rewarded video view count to a “Watch time” algorithm that rewarded viewer
    duration. This AI followed the audience everywhere to ensure it found the right
    video to put in front of them. It had the capability to recommend adjacent videos
    rather than clone videos (“adjacent” meaning similar but different enough to keep
    interest). “Clone” videos inevitably pushed viewers off the platform because they
    were watching basically the same thing on repeat. More importantly, it would queue
    videos based on how long viewers had watched them instead of how many clicks and
    views they had gotten.

  zh: YouTube与Google Brain合作，Google Brain是谷歌的机器学习团队，其人工智能开发和工具领先于其他领域。他们的目标是建立一个具有Google

    website longer. Misleading “bait‐and‐switch” tactics used by some creators were
    no longer being rewarded by the AI, because viewers left quickly when the content
    didn't deliver what the title and thumbnail promised. Viewers did stay to watch
    videos that delivered what they said they would, and the AI kept track of these
    videos with longer view duration and recommended them more. Additionally, viewers
    stayed to watch what the AI recommended next because they were relevant to what
    they had already shown interest in.

    first decade in the twenty‐first century, YouTube came face‐to‐face with some
    hard truths. First, their users were watching videos from a bunch of other platforms
    instead of coming to the site directly. YouTube viewership was up, but only because
    people were watching YouTube videos that had been shared to big platforms like

- en: Another tough truth was that YouTube had different operating programs for different
    devices and applications, so they needed to collect the pieces and reboot an operating
    system in one place, directly from the source. Shockingly, at the time, YouTube

- en: To really get down to the details, here's an explanation for exactly how the
    AI gathers data. Observing metadata starts with the thumbnail. The YouTube AI
    uses the advanced technology of Google's suite of AI products. It operates a program
    called Cloud Vision (CV). CV uses optical character recognition (OCR) and image
    recognition to determine lots of things about a video based on what it finds in
    the thumbnail. It takes points from each image in the thumbnail and, using billions
    of data points already in the system, recognizes those images, and feeds that
    information back into the algorithm. For example, a thumbnail including a close‐up
    of world‐renowned physicist Stephen Hawking's face is recognized as such in CV,
    so that video can be “grouped” in the suggested feed along with every other video
    on YouTube that has been tagged under the Stephen Hawking topic. **This is how
    your videos get discovered and watched.**
  id: totrans-102
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 要真正了解细节，这里有一个关于AI如何收集数据的解释。观察元数据始于缩略图。YouTube AI使用了谷歌AI产品套件的先进技术。它运行一个名为Cloud
    Vision（CV）的程序。CV使用光学字符识别（OCR）和图像识别来确定视频的许多内容，基于它在缩略图中发现的内容。它从缩略图中的每个图像中获取点数，并使用系统中已有的数十亿数据点来识别这些图像，并将这些信息反馈到算法中。例如，缩略图中包含世界著名物理学家斯蒂芬·霍金的近距离照片，CV会识别出这一点，因此该视频可以与YouTube上所有其他标记为斯蒂芬·霍金主题的视频一起在建议的视频中“分组”。**这就是你的视频是如何被发现和观看的。**
- en: In addition, CV utilizes a “safety” tool that determines, based on the data
    it has gathered from the images in your thumbnail, if your video is safe for all
    audiences to watch, or if it has adult themes, violence, or other questionable
    content, and it gives a “confidence” score of that determination. This score also
    reflects how accurately the content matches what the thumbnail shows. This means
    that you can create a thumbnail, plug it into Cloud Vision, and know before you
    finalize your video upload how the thumbnail will likely be rated in the system.
    Using Cloud Vision can help catch something that might, for whatever reason, be
    flagged as inappropriate on any data point, and therefore can give creators the
    opportunity to fix it even before it is live. This has cut down on demonetization
    and other issues creators have had in the past. It can be a very valuable tool
    to help you stay one step ahead of the problems. CV is not an exact replica of
    YouTube's safety measures, but it is close enough that creators can get a good
    idea of how the content will be determined by YouTube. CV might tolerate something
    YouTube will not, but it is still a sufficient prelaunch tool to utilize.
  id: totrans-103
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 此外，CV还利用了一个“安全”工具，根据它从缩略图中收集的数据来确定你的视频是否适合所有观众观看，或者是否包含成人主题、暴力或其他有争议的内容，并给出了这一决定的“信心”评分。这个评分也反映了内容与缩略图所显示的内容的匹配程度。这意味着你可以创建一个缩略图，将它插入到Cloud
    Vision中，在最终上传视频之前就知道这个缩略图在系统中可能会被评定为什么样的。使用Cloud Vision可以帮助发现一些可能因为某种原因被标记为不适当的内容，并因此可以让创作者在视频上线之前就有机会修复它。这减少了创作者过去所遇到的取消广告和其他问题。这可以是一个非常有价值的工具，帮助你在问题出现之前保持领先。CV并不是YouTube安全措施的完全复制品，但它足够接近，让创作者可以很好地了解YouTube会如何确定内容。CV可能容忍YouTube不会容忍的内容，但它仍然是一个足够的上线前工具来利用。

    For example, two different creators might both talk about Stephen Hawking in their
    videos, but one video might be biographical or scientific while the other might
    be humorous or entertaining. Even though both videos are talking about the same

    metadata, but they can''t lie about what''s actually in the content. Don''t slap
    a title and description on your video haphazardly just to get it finished and
    uploaded. The verbiage matters, so choose your words wisely. Most creators don''t
    leverage the video description to its fullest potential. It''s another data point

    higher hit rate, and they all feed into the YouTube AI. They have separate hit
    rates to determine what actually works for users in each particular system. Hit
    rate means how often viewers are able to find what they actually want to watch.
    Have you ever heard of a fisherman getting a “hit?” It's when a fish takes the
    bait. Imagine that you are the fisherman who has tossed his video into the water.
    Potential viewers are the fish swimming by your “bait.” Maybe 10 fish take a look
    at the bait and swim on by because it's not the brand of bait that they like.
    But along comes a fish who says, “That looks good,” and he bites. Say you toss
    this line 10 times, and while 100 fish swam past, 10 took the bait. There's your
    hit rate. This hit rate is so important to each system in the AI. The algorithms
    are very sensitive to user behavior and the metadata on each traffic source so
    that they know how to change to increase the hit rate.

    your videos, the algorithm plugs your videos into the Up Next feed, and your video's
    likelihood of being watched skyrockets. Metadata includes title, keywords, description,
    and the content itself. We talk in depth about metadata in [Part III](p03.xhtml)
